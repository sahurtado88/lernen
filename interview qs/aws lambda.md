# AWS Question 

1. What is AWS Lambda, and how does it fit into a DevOps environment?

Answer: AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. It fits into a DevOps environment by enabling the execution of functions in response to events, making it valuable for automation, application scaling, and event-driven workflows.

2. Explain the concept of an AWS Lambda function and its key components.

Answer: An AWS Lambda function is a piece of code that is executed in response to an event. Key components include the function code, runtime, handler, execution role, and triggers. The handler is the entry point for the function code, and triggers define what events invoke the function.

3. What are the programming languages and runtimes supported by AWS Lambda, and how do you choose the appropriate runtime for your function?

Answer: AWS Lambda supports various runtimes, including Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Ruby, .NET Core, and custom runtimes. You choose the appropriate runtime based on the language you are comfortable with and the specific requirements of your function.

4. How do you deploy and update AWS Lambda functions, and what is the role of versioning and aliases in managing functions?

Answer: You can deploy and update functions using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or SDKs. Versioning and aliases allow you to manage different versions of a function and control which version or alias is invoked by other services or applications.

5. Explain the concept of AWS Lambda event sources and provide examples of services that can trigger Lambda functions.

Answer: AWS Lambda event sources are services that invoke Lambda functions in response to events. Examples include Amazon S3, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon SNS, Amazon SQS, AWS API Gateway, and custom applications using AWS SDKs.

6. What is the significance of AWS Lambda execution roles, and how do you assign and manage permissions for Lambda functions?

Answer: AWS Lambda execution roles define the permissions a function has to interact with AWS services and resources. You assign permissions by attaching an execution role to the function, and you can manage permissions using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies.

7. Explain the differences between provisioned concurrency and on-demand concurrency in AWS Lambda. When would you use each?

Answer:
— Provisioned concurrency is a feature that pre-warms function instances to handle traffic spikes. It is useful when you need consistent low-latency response times and control over scaling.
— On-demand concurrency allows Lambda to scale automatically based on incoming requests. It’s suitable for workloads with variable or unpredictable traffic patterns.

8. What is AWS Lambda Layers, and how can they be used to share code and libraries across multiple functions?

Answer: AWS Lambda Layers are a distribution mechanism for libraries, custom runtimes, and other function dependencies. They allow you to manage and share code and resources across multiple functions, reducing duplication and making updates more efficient.

9. Explain the cost model of AWS Lambda, including how you are billed and what factors can affect the cost of running Lambda functions.

Answer: AWS Lambda charges based on the number of requests, compute duration, and memory used. Factors that can affect the cost include function runtime, memory allocation, and the number of requests. Careful configuration can help optimize costs.

10. How can you troubleshoot and monitor AWS Lambda functions, and what AWS services can you use for logging and monitoring Lambda executions?

Answer: You can troubleshoot and monitor Lambda functions using Amazon CloudWatch for logging and metrics, AWS X-Ray for tracing, and AWS CloudTrail for auditing. CloudWatch Logs provide detailed logs for Lambda function executions.

11. Explain the concept of AWS Step Functions and how they can be used in conjunction with Lambda functions to build complex workflows.

Answer: AWS Step Functions allow you to build serverless workflows by coordinating and orchestrating multiple AWS services, including Lambda functions. They provide state management, error handling, and flow control for complex applications and workflows.

12. How do you ensure the security of Lambda functions, and what are best practices for securing function execution, data, and dependencies?

Answer: Best practices for securing Lambda functions include:
— Applying least privilege IAM policies.
— Securing function code and dependencies.
— Encrypting data at rest and in transit.
— Implementing environment variables for sensitive information.
— Regularly updating and monitoring functions for security vulnerabilities.


# AWS q 2
1. What is AWS Lambda?
AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. Lambda runs code only when needed and scales automatically, from a few requests per day to thousands per second.

2. What are the main components of a Lambda function?
The main components of a Lambda function are:

- Handler: This is the entry point for our function, a method in our code that processes the invocation event. Think of it as the "main" function of our Lambda code.
- Event: This is the JSON-formatted input data that triggers the function's execution. It carries information about what initiated the function call.
- Context: This is an object containing runtime information about the function's execution environment. It includes details like function name, version, memory limits, request ID, and remaining execution time.
- Environment variables: These are key-value pairs that you can set to configure your Lambda function's behavior without modifying the code itself. They are often used to store API keys, database credentials, or other settings.

3. What languages does Lambda support?
Lambda natively supports Node.js, Python, Ruby, Java, Go, C#, and PowerShell. This means we can write our Lambda functions directly in these languages without additional setup.

Additionally, Lambda allows us to use custom runtimes, providing the flexibility to package our function code and dependencies in a container image. This enables support for virtually any programming language, allowing us to choose the tool that best suits our needs.

4. How to create a Lambda function?

There are several ways to create Lambda functions:

5. What are the different ways to invoke a Lambda Function?
We can invoke Lambda functions in several ways:

- Synchronous invocation: The client waits for the function to complete and return a response.
- Asynchronous invocation: The client doesn't wait for a response—Lambda executes the function in the background.
- Event source mapping: Lambda automatically polls services like DynamoDB or Kinesis and invokes functions based on events.
- Other methods: These include API Gateway, AWS SDKs, or scheduled invocations via Amazon EventBridge.

# Intermediate AWS Lambda Interview Questions

1. How can we deploy dependencies alongside Lambda code?
There are a few options for packaging dependencies with Lambda code:

- Direct inclusion: For interpreted languages, we can put dependency files along with our function code in the .zip deployment package.
- Lambda layers: For compiled languages or larger dependencies, we can use Lambda layers to separately package and share common dependencies across functions.
- Container images: We can also package dependencies in container images along with the Lambda function code and a custom runtime.

2. How can we optimize the performance of Lambda functions?
We have several options to optimize Lambda functions:

- Memory allocation: Choosing the right memory size is crucial for balancing cost and performance. Tools like AWS Lambda Power Tuning can help find the optimal configuration.
- Package size: Smaller function packages lead to faster cold starts (the time it takes for a Lambda function to initialize on its first invocation). Minimize package size by removing unnecessary dependencies and compressing code.
- Lambda SnapStart: This feature pre-initializes function environments, significantly reducing cold start times for specific runtimes.
- Provisioned concurrency: Configure provisioned concurrency to keep function instances warm, ensuring consistent response times for critical workloads.
- Timeouts and concurrency limits: Set appropriate timeouts and reserved concurrency to prevent runaway functions and maintain a stable Lambda environment.

3. What tools can you use to monitor and debug Lambda functions?
Lambda automatically sends metrics to Amazon CloudWatch, including number of requests, latency, error rates, and more.

We can use CloudWatch Logs to access logs that our function code and the Lambda runtime generate.

For tracing and troubleshooting the performance of distributed Lambda applications, we can use AWS X-Ray.

4. What are Lambda extensions used for?

Lambda extensions enable us to enhance our functions by integrating with monitoring, observability, security, and governance tools.

Extensions can run as separate processes in the execution environment to capture diagnostic information or send data to custom destinations.

Examples include the Datadog extension for metrics and traces, and the AWS AppConfig extension for dynamic configuration updates.

5. What is an event source mapping?

An event source mapping is a Lambda resource that reads items from an event source and invokes a function.

We can use event source mappings to process items from Amazon DynamoDB streams, Amazon Kinesis streams, Amazon MQ queues, self-managed Apache Kafka, Amazon SQS queues, and more.

Lambda provides a polling mechanism to read batches of records from the event sources and invoke a function.

# Advanced AWS Lambda Interview Questions

1. How do you control access to Lambda functions?
AWS Lambda uses IAM (Identity and Access Management) to control access at two levels:

- Resource-based policies specify which AWS accounts, services, and resources are allowed to invoke the function.

- The function's execution role determines what AWS services and resources the function code can access. Following the principle of least privilege, these policies should be as restrictive as possible while still allowing the function to perform its intended tasks.

2. How can you minimize cold starts in Lambda?

Cold starts occur when Lambda needs to initialize a new execution environment to process an invocation request. To minimize cold starts and improve our Lambda function's responsiveness, we can employ several strategies:

- Utilize SnapStart: This feature (available for certain runtimes) allows us to persist initialized environments, significantly reducing startup times for subsequent invocations.
- Enable provisioned concurrency: By keeping a pool of initialized environments ready, we can eliminate cold starts for predictable workloads.
- Optimize package size: Reducing the size of our function package by removing unnecessary dependencies and optimizing code can accelerate the initialization process.
- Language choice: Opting for languages like Go or Rust, known for faster startup times than JVM languages, can also help mitigate cold start delays.
- Execution context reuse: Keeping our Lambda function code separate from the initial setup logic allows us to reuse the execution context between invocations, further reducing overhead.

3. What are some common API security best practices for Lambda?
When exposing Lambda functions via API Gateway, some security best practices include:

- Using IAM or Lambda authorizers to authenticate and authorize requests.
- Enabling Amazon Cognito user pools for user management.
- Defining resource policies to allow or deny access based on request properties like source IPs.
- Setting up mTLS for secure client-server communication.
- Using AWS WAF to protect against common web exploits targeting APIs.

4. What are the differences between Lambda container images and .zip deployment packages?

Lambda container images allow packaging function code and dependencies in an OCI-compatible container format. Let’s compare container images with .zip deployment packages:

5. Can Lambda functions call other Lambda functions?

Yes, Lambda functions can invoke other functions directly using the AWS SDK. Common use cases include function orchestration, aggregating results from multiple functions, and fanning out event processing.

When a Lambda function invokes another, the invoked function's resource-based policy should explicitly grant access to allow invocation from the calling function.

# Practical AWS Lambda Interview Questions

1. How do you implement a simple REST API using Lambda and API Gateway?
We can implement a simple REST API using Lambda and API Gateway by taking the following steps:

    1. Create a Lambda function: Develop a Lambda function that receives input from API Gateway as an event object and returns a response object with data and status codes.
    2. Create an API Gateway: In the API Gateway, we create a new REST API with a resource and method corresponding to the API path and the HTTP method.
    3. Configure the integration: We configure the method's integration type as Lambda proxy and specify the function to invoke
    4. Deploy the API: Deploy the API to generate a public URL endpoint for access.
    5. Test thoroughly: We can use tools like cURL or Postman to ensure the API functions correctly, with the Lambda function handling requests and returning appropriate responses.

2. How do you configure a Lambda function to process events from an S3 bucket?

We can configure a Lambda function to process events from an S3 bucket by taking the steps below:

1. We create a Lambda function with the appropriate permissions to access the S3 bucket.
2. In the S3 console, we configure an event notification on the source bucket.
3. We choose the event types to trigger the notification, such as object creation or deletion.
4. We specify the Lambda function as the notification destination.
5. We test by performing actions on the S3 bucket that match the configured event types.
6. We verify that the Lambda function is invoked with an event containing details of the S3 action.

3. How do you configure a Lambda function to write data to a DynamoDB table?
We can configure a Lambda function to write data to a DynamoDB table by performing these six steps:

We create a DynamoDB table with an appropriate primary key and any required secondary indexes.

1. We create an IAM role for the Lambda function with permissions to access DynamoDB.
2. We create a Lambda function and attach the IAM role.
3. We use the DynamoDB SDK to create a client instance with the table name.
4. We use the put_item method to write items to the table, specifying the key attributes and other fields.
5. Test the function with sample events and use DynamoDB queries to verify data is written correctly.


4. How do you implement a scheduled Lambda function?
We can implement a scheduled Lambda function by taking these steps–we:

1. Create a Lambda function to perform the desired task on a schedule.
2. Open the Amazon EventBridge console and create a new rule.
3. Define a schedule expression for the rule using rate or cron syntax.
4. Select the Lambda function as a target for the rule.
5. Save the rule and test by waiting for the next scheduled event.
6. Verify the function's execution in CloudWatch metrics and logs.


5. How do you gradually shift traffic to a new version of a Lambda function?
To shift traffic to a new version of a Lambda function, we:

1. Publish a new version of the Lambda function with the updated code.
2. Create an alias that points to the older stable version.
3. Update the alias to split traffic between the old and new versions using weights (e.g., 90/10).
4. Gradually adjust the weights to shift more traffic to the new version while monitoring metrics.
5. Once satisfied, update the alias to send 100% of the traffic to the new version.
6. Repeat the process for the next function update, treating the previous version as the new stable version.


# Provisioned concurrency

Provisioned Concurrency is a Lambda feature that prepares concurrent execution environments in advance of invocations. Consequently, this can be used to address two issues. First, if expected traffic arrives more quickly than the default burst capacity, Provisioned Concurrency can ensure that your function is available to meet the demand. Second, if you have latency-sensitive workloads that require predictable double-digit millisecond latency, Provisioned Concurrency solves the typical cold start issues associated with default scaling.
