# Monitoring

Monitoring is collecting and visualizing data about systems regularly so the system's health can be viewed and tracked

3 questions of monitoring

1. Is the service on?
2. Is the service functioning as expected?
3. Is the service performing well

the data that is collected for monitoring is called Telemetry data

Telemetry data is used to find where the problem might be

# MTTD Mean time to Detection

MTTD is the amount of time, on average, between the start of an issue and when teams become aware of it

# MTTR mean time to resolve

MTTR is the average amount of time between when an issue is detected, and when systems are fixed and operating normally

# foundattion of Observability

Answer: Observability as code involves defining observability configurations, such as metrics collection, log formatting, and tracing setups, using version-controlled code. This approach ensures consistency, repeatability, and ease of deployment for observability practices across environments. It also facilitates collaboration and review of observability configurations as part of the development process.

## Technical Implementation
# 45. What are some best practices for instrumenting code for observability?

Answer: Best practices for instrumenting code for observability include using standard libraries and frameworks for metrics, logs, and traces, ensuring that instrumentation is lightweight and does not introduce significant overhead, and making sure that all critical code paths and external interactions are covered. Additionally, it's important to use consistent formats and naming conventions for easier analysis and correlation.

46. How do you handle high cardinality in metrics and logs?

Answer: Handling high cardinality involves strategies like aggregating data to reduce the number of unique labels or log entries, using sampling to collect only a subset of data points, and employing dynamic tagging to only include relevant tags in certain contexts. It also involves optimizing storage and querying to efficiently handle large volumes of data.

47. Describe a situation where you had to troubleshoot a complex production issue using observability tools.

Answer: Provide a specific example based on your own personal experiences, detailing the issue, how you used metrics, logs, and traces to diagnose the problem, the tools involved, and the outcome. Highlight any challenges faced and how they were overcome.

48. What strategies do you use to ensure the reliability of your observability data?

Answer: Ensuring the reliability of observability data involves implementing redundant data collection mechanisms, validating data at the source, regularly testing and verifying observability configurations, and monitoring the health of observability tools themselves. It also includes setting up alerts for anomalies in observability data collection and processing pipelines.

# 49. How do you prioritize which metrics, logs, and traces to collect in a resource-constrained environment?

Answer: In a resource-constrained environment, prioritize collecting metrics, logs, and traces that are most critical to the application's health and performance. Focus on key performance indicators, high-impact error logs, and essential traces that provide insights into critical user journeys. Use sampling and aggregation to reduce data volume and implement efficient storage and querying practices.

# 50. Can you explain the concept of observability maturity and how you would assess it in an organization?

Answer: Observability maturity refers to the extent to which an organization has implemented and integrated observability practices. Assessing it involves evaluating factors like the coverage and quality of metrics, logs, and traces; the effectiveness of alerting and incident response; the integration of observability with development and operations processes; and the ability to proactively identify and resolve issues. A maturity model can be used to systematically assess and improve observability practices.

# Understanding SLA, SLO, SLI and Error Budgets

## SLA: The Promise service level agreement

It’s a formal agreement between a service provider and the end user that defines the level of service expected, like system uptime or response time.

So to have an SLA defined you need to have

Service Provider
Service User
Service
Metric

The Service Provider, provides service to a service user and specifies the commitment to provide the service as per the defined metrics over a period of time. This offer has to be agreed by the service user. A formal agreement is then termed as SLA.

## SLO service level objective

SLOs are the specific goals set by a provider to achieve the standards set in the SLA.

## SLI: Measuring the Service

Service Level Indicators (SLIs) are the metrics used to measure the service’s performance against the SLO.

SLIs could be the actual uptime percentage or the average response time of a system.

## Error Budgets

In IT, an Error Budget is the amount of time services can be down without breaching the SLA. It’s a crucial part of reliability engineering, allowing teams to balance innovation and reliability.

The error budget is essentially the amount of time a service is allowed to be unavailable or not meeting the SLO before it breaches the SLA.

This error budget represents the amount of additional downtime you can afford without breaching the SLA, given that you’re aiming to meet the SLO. It’s a buffer that allows for some level of imperfection in service delivery while still maintaining the overall agreement with the client or user.
