What is AWS Kinesis, and how does it work?
Answer: AWS Kinesis is a fully managed platform that enables you to ingest, process, and analyze real-time streaming data at scale. It consists of three main services: Kinesis Data Streams, Kinesis Data Firehose, and Kinesis Data Analytics. Kinesis Data Streams allows you to build custom applications that process and analyze streaming data in real time. Kinesis Data Firehose simplifies the process of loading streaming data into AWS data stores and analytics services. Kinesis Data Analytics enables you to run SQL queries on streaming data and gain insights in real time. Kinesis works by ingesting data from various sources, partitioning it into shards, and distributing it across multiple consumers for processing.

How does data retention work in AWS Kinesis, and what are the considerations for scalability?
Answer: Data retention in AWS Kinesis varies based on the service you’re using. In Kinesis Data Streams, data retention is based on the retention period you specify when creating a stream, which can range from 24 hours to 7 days. Kinesis Data Firehose retains data for a shorter period, typically up to 24 hours, before automatically loading it into the destination data store. Scalability considerations in Kinesis revolve around the number of shards in a stream, which determines the throughput capacity. You can dynamically adjust the number of shards to scale the throughput up or down based on your application’s requirements.

How do you handle data processing failures in AWS Kinesis?
Answer: AWS Kinesis provides mechanisms for handling data processing failures to ensure fault tolerance and data integrity. In Kinesis Data Streams, you can configure error handling and retry logic in your consumer applications to handle transient failures, such as network errors or processing exceptions. Additionally, you can use Amazon Kinesis Enhanced Fan-Out to replicate data across multiple consumers, ensuring redundancy and fault tolerance. In Kinesis Data Firehose, you can enable automatic retries and configure dead-letter queues to capture and analyze failed records, enabling you to troubleshoot and address processing errors.
