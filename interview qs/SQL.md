SQL Functions
In this section we have compiled SQL cheat sheet for SQL functions. It is used for common tasks like aggregation, filtering, date/time manipulation, and more!

51. Scalar Functions: Functions That Return a Single Value
SELECT UPPER(first_name) AS upper_case_name FROM employees;
This query uses the UPPER() scalar function to convert the first_name column values to uppercase.

52. Aggregate Functions: Functions That Operate on a Set of Values and Return a Single Value
SELECT AVG(salary) AS average_salary FROM employees;
This query uses the AVG() aggregate function to calculate the average salary of all employees.

53. String Functions: Functions That Manipulate String Values
SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name FROM employees;
This query uses the CONCAT() string function to concatenate the first_name and last_name columns into a single column called full_name.

SELECT SUBSTR(first_name, 1, 3) AS short_name FROM employees;
This query uses the SUBSTR() function to extract the first three characters of the first_name column for each employee. The result is displayed in a new column called short_name.

SELECT INSERT(full_name, 6, 0, 'Amazing ') AS modified_name 
FROM (SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name FROM employees) AS employee_names;
This query first concatenates the first_name and last_name columns into a single column called full_name. Then, it uses the INSERT() function to insert the string ‘Amazing ‘ at the 6th position of the full_name column for each employee. The modified names are displayed in a new column called modified_name.

54. Date and Time Functions: Functions That Operate on Date and Time Values
SELECT CURRENT_DATE AS current_date FROM dual;
This query uses the CURRENT_DATE date function to retrieve the current date.

55. Mathematical Functions: Functions That Perform Mathematical Operations
SELECT SQRT(25) AS square_root FROM dual;
This query uses the SQRT() mathematical function to calculate the square root of 25.

Subqueries in SQL
This SQL cheat sheet explains how to nest queries for powerful data filtering and manipulation within a single statement.

56. Single-row Subquery: Returns One Row of Result
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE salary = (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees);
In this example, the subquery (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees) returns a single row containing the maximum salary, and it’s used to filter employees who have the maximum salary.

57. Multiple-row Subquery: Returns Multiple Rows of Result
SELECT department_name
FROM departments
WHERE department_id IN (SELECT department_id FROM employees);
In this example, the subquery (SELECT department_id FROM employees) returns multiple rows containing department IDs, and it’s used to filter department names based on those IDs.

58. Correlated Subquery: References a Column from the Outer Query
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employees e
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees WHERE department = e.department);
In this example, the subquery (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees WHERE department = e.department) is correlated with the outer query by referencing the department column from the outer query. It calculates the average salary for each department and is used to filter employees whose salary is greater than the average salary of their respective department.

59. Nested Subquery: A Subquery Inside Another Subquery
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE department_id IN (
    SELECT department_id
    FROM departments
    WHERE department_name = 'IT'
);
In this example, the subquery (SELECT department_id FROM departments WHERE department_name = ‘IT’) is nested within the outer query. It retrieves the department ID for the IT department, which is then used in the outer query to filter employees belonging to the IT department.
