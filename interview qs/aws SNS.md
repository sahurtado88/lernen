1. What is AWS SNS?
Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) is a fully managed messaging service in Amazon Web Services (AWS) that enables you to send messages to multiple recipients or devices in a flexible and scalable way. SNS supports a variety of messaging protocols, including SMS, email, and HTTP, and it can be used to send messages to a wide range of endpoints, including mobile phones, email addresses, and web applications.

With SNS, you can create topics and subscribe endpoints to the topics. When you publish a message to a topic, SNS will automatically deliver the message to all the subscribed endpoints. You can use SNS to send messages to recipients in a one-to-many fashion, and you can also use it to build event-driven architectures, such as mobile push notifications or real-time message processing pipelines.

SNS is a fully managed service, which means that it handles all the underlying infrastructure, messaging protocols, and scaling for you. You only pay for the messages that you send and the number of endpoints that you subscribe to your topics.

Overall, AWS SNS is a fully managed messaging service that enables you to send messages to multiple recipients or devices in a flexible and scalable way. You can use SNS to send messages to a wide range of endpoints, and you can also use it to build event-driven architectures. SNS is fully managed, which means that it handles all the underlying infrastructure, messaging protocols, and scaling for you.

2. How does AWS SNS work?
Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) is a fully managed messaging service in Amazon Web Services (AWS) that enables you to send messages to multiple recipients or devices in a flexible and scalable way. Here’s how AWS SNS works:

Create a topic: A topic is a logical access point and communication channel in SNS. You can create a topic and specify a name and a display name for the topic. The display name is used to identify the topic in the AWS Management Console.
Subscribe endpoints to the topic: You can subscribe to various types of endpoints to a topic, such as email addresses, mobile phone numbers, or web applications. When you subscribe to an endpoint to a topic, SNS will send a confirmation message to the endpoint, and the endpoint will need to confirm the subscription before it can receive messages from the topic.
Publish a message to the topic: When you publish a message to a topic, SNS will automatically deliver the message to all the subscribed endpoints. You can specify the message in a variety of formats, such as plain text, JSON, or XML, and you can also specify the messaging protocol that you want to use, such as SMS, email, or HTTP.
Receive the message: When an endpoint receives a message from a topic, it can process the message according to its own logic. For example, an email address might receive the message as an email, and a mobile phone might receive the message as an SMS.
Overall, AWS SNS works by enabling you to create topics, subscribe endpoints to the topics, and publish messages to the topics. SNS will automatically deliver the messages to all the subscribed endpoints, and the endpoints can receive and process the messages according to their own logic.

3. What are the benefits of Amazon SNS?
Amazon SNS offers 4 key benefits including:

High Reliability
The Amazon SNS service stores its messages in cross-availability zones across AWS regions. As a result, each message is now available across multiple regions at the same time – thus providing high reliability. Additionally, Amazon Web Service (AWS) has a global network of data centers that allows publishers to send messages at any time.

Amazon SNS also supports messaging on all AWS endpoints including Amazon SQS and AWS Lambda. In case the subscriber endpoint is not supported, the SNS service retries message delivery and can move its messages to dead-letter queries (or DLQ).

Automatic Scalability
With the Amazon SNS service, you can dynamically scale the number of your message requests from any application. Amazon SNS uses the scaling capability of the AWS cloud platform to achieve this benefit.

Apart from automatic scalability, Amazon SNS is designed for high throughput and changes in traffic patterns. With Amazon SNS, you can plan your workload using capacity planning and provisioning. Plus, there is no upfront cost nor the need to install any messaging software.

Message Filtering
Using the Amazon SNS service, you can simplify your overall messaging architecture by removing your message filtering mechanism (from the subscriber) and message routing (from the publisher). The SNS service takes care of your message filtering that allows subscribers to only receive messages of their interest – instead of all the published messages in the SNS topic.

Security
As an SNS topic owner, you can set topic-related policies that specify the type of network protocols. You can also specify the users who can publish or subscribe to a particular topic. Other security measures include the limit on the number of daily messages along with keeping messages for “one-time password” (or OTP) transactions private and secure.

Amazon SNS also supports message encryption to keep your data secure. With the use of the Amazon PrivateLink service, you can publish private messages to SNS topics from any Amazon VPC subnet.

4. How to Create an Amazon SNS Topic?
To create an Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic, you can follow these steps:

Go to the Amazon SNS dashboard in the AWS Management Console
Click the “Create topic” button
Enter a name and a display name for the topic
Click the “Create topic” button
The name of the topic is used to identify the topic in the API and the AWS Management Console, and the display name is used to identify the topic in the console. The display name can be any string up to 100 characters in length.

Once you have created the topic, you can subscribe endpoints to the topic, such as email addresses, mobile phone numbers, or web applications. When you subscribe to an endpoint to a topic, SNS will send a confirmation message to the endpoint, and the endpoint will need to confirm the subscription before it can receive messages from the topic.

You can also use the AWS SDKs or the SNS API to create a topic programmatically.

Overall, these are the steps to create an Amazon SNS topic: go to the Amazon SNS dashboard in the AWS Management Console, click the “Create topic” button, enter a name and a display name for the topic, and click the “Create topic” button. You can then subscribe endpoints to the topic and start publishing messages to the topic.

5. How to Set Filter Policies for the SNS Subscriptions?
To set filter policies for an Amazonhttps://datavalley.ai/demystifying-spark-sql-a-guide-to-creating-table/ Simple Notification Service (SNS) subscription, you can use the AWS Management Console, the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), or the AWS SDKs.

For example, if you are in the free tier for SNS, you can send up to 1 million SMS messages and 1 million HTTP/HTTPS messages per month for free. However, if you exceed these limits, you will be charged for the additional messages that you send.

Overall, the cost of sending 1 million messages through SNS depends on the messaging protocol that you use and the number of endpoints that you subscribe to your topics. You can use the AWS Pricing Calculator to estimate the cost of sending messages through SNS for your specific use case.

7. What is the difference between direct and fanout messaging models? Which one is preferred in which situations?
Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) supports two messaging models: direct messaging and fanout messaging. Here’s the difference between the two models:

Direct messaging: In the direct messaging model, a publisher sends a message to a single recipient or a small group of recipients. The recipients can be specified using a list of endpoints, such as email addresses or mobile phone numbers. Direct messaging is useful when you want to send a message to a specific group of recipients, and you don’t need to broadcast the message to a large number of recipients.
Fanout messaging: In the fanout messaging model, a publisher sends a message to a topic, and the message is delivered to all the subscribers of the topic. Fanout messaging is useful when you want to broadcast a message to a large number of recipients, and you don’t need to specify the recipients individually.
Which messaging model you should use depends on your specific use case. If you want to send a message to a specific group of recipients, you can use the direct messaging model. If you want to broadcast a message to a large number of recipients, you can use the fanout messaging model.

Overall, the difference between the direct and fanout messaging models in SNS is that the direct model is used to send a message to a specific group of recipients, while the fanout model is used to broadcast a message to a large number of recipients. You can choose the appropriate messaging model based on your specific use case.
