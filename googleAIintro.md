Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence technology that can produce various types of content, including text, imagery, audio, and synthetic data.

AI is a branch of computer science that deals with the creation of intelligence agents, which are systems that can reason, and learn, and act autonomously.

Essentially, AI has to do with the theory and methods to build machines that think and act like humans.

In this discipline, we have machine learning, which is a subfield of AI.

That trained model can make useful predictions from new or never before seen data drawn from the same one used to train the model.
Machine learning gives the computer the ability to learn without explicit programming.

Two of the most common classes of machine learning models are unsupervised and supervised ML models.
