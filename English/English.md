"... it can respond to you with follow-up questions and statements ..."

resemble: To resemble something is to look or be like it. Mark's new home resembles his old apartment. Both have a minimalist theme.

"... there usually was some sort of interface that you had to use in between."

stalling: Stalling is delaying on purpose because you need more time, usually to think or to do something. Clarissa is an expert at stalling. She engages clients in small talk until her boss is ready to meet them.

"Siri is very clever about stalling."

kind of: This is an informal expression that means "somewhat" or "to some small degree." I'm kind of worried about my upcoming presentation. I know it's good, but I'm not sure if the clients will get it.

"... you're being kind of kept waiting."

Grammar tip: The question words "where" and "how"

Questions words are used when asking about different things.

We use the question word where to ask about location:

"Siri, where are you from?"

Meanwhile, we use how together with certain words to ask about quantity, manner, procedure and length:

"How far away is Jupiter?"

"How old are you?"

More examples:

Where have you been?
Where did you put the folder?
Where is Leanne? She's not in her work station.

How bad was the car accident?
How long will the job interview take?
How much money do we have?


"Either ... or ..." is often used to talk about a choice between two possibilities.

You can have either tea or coffee.

Sometimes more than two choices are given.

Would you like to add some syrup to your coffee? You can have either mint, hazelnut or caramel.

An "either ... or ..." sentence must have a balanced structure, so that the same kind of words or expressions follow "either" and "or."

He's either in London or in Rome.
(In this sentence, "in London" and "in Rome" are prepositional phrases.)

"Either ... or ..." is used to talk about two or more choices.

An "either ... or ..." sentence must have a balanced structure, so that the same kind of words or expressions follow "either" and "or."

You can ask about a person's job:

What do you do in Company A?

If the person has mentioned that he/she has children, then it's okay to ask how many children he/she has, and what the children's ages are.

How many children do you have?
How old are they?

You can talk about other light topics:

How was your flight?

How was the traffic?

Do you like the weather?

Really? How many months along are you?



Hello. You two look familiar. Have we met before?

spirit animal: a metaphor that refers to someone or something that a person can relate to or admire

Ryan jokes that his spirit animal is a sloth, because he just wants to sleep and eat all day.

"Phyllis Diller is my spirit animal, basically."

Grammar tip: Relative clauses that start with "which"

A relative clause is a dependent clause that begins with a relative pronoun, such as who, whose, where, when and which.

A relative clause that starts with which gives more information about the noun that precedes the clause.

"My piano, which I don't play anymore."

"The toaster is inside the cabinet, which I don't necessarily like, but I don't hate."

More examples:

For the camping trip, Alana let Brent borrow a tent, which can accommodate two people.
Brett has flexible working hours, which allows him to go to work later than other employees.
Nora has an excellent attendance record, which positively affects her chances of being promoted at work.

"If" and "whether" are words that imply uncertainty. They are often used interchangeably in informal speech and writing, but in formal communication, it is better to remember the rules for using the two words.

"If"and "whether" may be used interchangeably in relation to yes or no questions. If you are in a formal communication context, it is better to use "whether."

"If" should be used when talking about a condition.

"Whether" is used when two or more options exist.

"Whether or not" is used when two alternatives are possible, and the same action is done or should be done in either case.

Grammar tip: The zero and first conditional

Conditionals are sentences used to discuss hypothetical situations, and their effects or consequences. A conditional usually includes a conditional clause, also known as the if-clause.

The zero conditional is used when making statements about real or factual situations at the present time. It is formed by combining the condition (if + simple present tense), and the result (simple present tense.)

"But if birds know that there's a predator chasing them, they start to leave the area ..."

More examples:

If the temperature drops below zero, it snows.
Food spoils if it is in a hot place for several days.

The first conditional, also known as the "real conditional," is used when talking about possibilities and their results. The first conditional is formed by combining the condition (if + simple present tense), and the result (will + the zero infinitive).

"... even if the next generation comes through, they'll go, 'Well, I don't know why I don't want to go there ...'"

"If you can start to change where they nest ... the likelihood is they'll stay away as well ..."

More examples:

If Marty sees Jennifer tomorrow, he will tell her about the department's upcoming project.
The manager will sign the documents if it is delivered within the day.

# zero conditional


# first conditional
The first conditional describes what will happen if a condition is met.

If you prepare well, you will win the account.

The first conditional sentence is formed by combining a condition (simple present tense) + a result (simple future tense).

If you don’t lower the price, the client will reject the proposal.
Unless you lower the price, the client will reject the proposal.

The first conditional or "the real conditional" talks about real possibilities.

It is formed with a condition (simple present tense) + a result (simple future tense).


# second conditional

The second conditional is often called "the unreal conditional" because it is used for situations that are impossible or not likely to happen.

The second conditional describes an imaginary result for an unreal situation.

If I won the lottery, I would buy a big house.
If we had a billion dollars, we would set up a movie production company.

The second conditional sentence is formed by combining CONDITION ("if" clause using the simple past tense) + RESULT (main clause using "would" + main verb).

If I were rich, I would quit my job.

We can contract "would" into "'d," and "would not" into "wouldn't":

I'd lower taxes if I were* the president.
He wouldn't lower taxes if he were* the president. 

*Although some people use "was" in second conditional statements, the more correct verb to use for both singular and plural nouns/pronouns in the second conditional is "were."

The second conditional is used for situations that are impossible or not likely to happen.

The second conditional is formed by combining the CONDITION ("if" clause using the simple past tense ) + RESULT (main clause using "would" + main verb).

# third conditional

The third conditional is often called "the past conditional" because it concerns only past situations.

It is used to talk about a past result that can no longer exist because the chance for its condition to be fulfilled has passed. There is always an unspoken "but ..." phrase.

If Greg had saved more money, he would have bought a bigger car.
(... but Greg did not save more money.)

You would have met the deadline if you had worked harder.
(... but you did not work harder.)

The third conditional sentence is formed by combining CONDITION ("if" + past perfect) +  RESULT (the main clause using "would" + "have" + past participle).

If we had arrived earlier, we would have been able to buy tickets.
If their goalkeeper had not been so good, we would have won the game.

An alternative form to "If ... had/had not ..." is "Had … would have …".

Had Greg saved more money, he would have bought a bigger car.
Had you worked harder, you would have met the deadline.

The third conditional is used to talk about a past result that is no longer possible. It follows the format:

CONDITION ("If" + past perfect) + RESULT ("... would have …" + past participle)

If you had arrived earlier, you would have seen the presentation.
If we had waited longer, we would have been caught in the rain.


# conditional mixt

# Conditionals using could

The use of "could" changes the level of certainty expressed in a conditional sentence.

In the second conditional, replace "would" with "could" to express less certainty about a hypothetical future result.

If I learned another language, I would get a better job. (certain)
If I learned another language, I could get a better job. (less certain)

In the third conditional, replace "would" with "could" to express less certainty about a hypothetical past result.

You would have gotten the job if you had gone to the interview. (certain)
You could have gotten the job if you had gone to the interview. (less certain)

Verbs followed by gerunds and infinitives

For some verbs such as "like," "love" and "hate," it makes no difference if they are followed by a gerund or an infinitive. The meaning of the sentence does not change: "I like swimming" (gerund) and "I like to swim" mean the same thing.

- "Stop" + gerund means to stop an activity completely.

Jack stopped smoking when he turned 40.
Philip and Rachel stopped buying soda because they wanted to limit their sugar intake.

- "Stop" + infinitive means to stop another activity in order to do the action stated in the infinitive phrase.

I worked the whole morning, but I stopped to smoke for 15 minutes.
We drove for two hours then stopped to buy some soda.

-"Go on" + gerund means to continue what one is already doing.

When I am interrupted by phone calls, it's difficult for me to go on working.

- "Go on" + infinitive means to move on to a different action that is related to the first one.

When you write an email, keep the introduction short and go on to state the purpose of your email immediately.
After the speaker gave her presentation, she went on to ask the audience for comments. 

- "Try" + gerund means to test out an option.

Have you tried restarting your computer?
If the customer can't be reached by phone, try sending him an email.

- "Try" + infinitive means to make an effort or to attempt.

I have tried to access my email several times already, but the system just won't work.

_________________

Restrictive clauses provide information about a noun.

Restrictive clauses give information that you need in order to understand the sentence correctly. They are not enclosed by commas.

The player who has the number 10 printed on his shirt is the team captain.

If you take the restrictive clause away, the sentence loses very important information. You can no longer distinguish who among the players is the team captain.

The player is the team captain.

Nonrestrictive clauses also provide information about a noun.

Unlike restrictive clauses, nonrestrictive clauses give extra information. They are always written between commas.

Player number 10, who is the team captain, will take the trophy home.

If you leave out the nonrestrictive clause between the commas, the sentence still gives the same basic information.

Player number 10 will take the trophy home.

Grammar tip: Present vs past participles

Participles are words that look like verbs but are used as adjectives or adverbs.

Present participles describe the state of an object, or show what an object is used for. They can also be used to change the tense of a verb. Present participles end with the suffix -ing.

"... and it carried an interesting payload: a dummy astronaut riding a Tesla car that was orbiting space."

Past participles are used to describe an action that was done to an object or person. Most past participles end in -ed, -en, -d, -t, or -n.

"The company is valued at over $50 billion."

Rica was treasured by her teammates because of her hard work and dedication to her job.

________________________

party: a person or group that is taking part in a discussion or negotiation

After several hours of talk and compromise, each party in the meeting was able to get what he or she wanted.

"In some cultures, it's appropriate [...] to tell the other party he's wrong."

irreconcilable: describing a situation or event that is impossible to fix, resolve or deal with

The partnership between the two firms was unsuccessful because there were irreconcilable differences between the companies' desired goals.

Daniel is a marketing specialist for Sunlight Inc. in the U.S.; he often has discussions about global marketing solutions with Michelle, his counterpart in Sunlight Inc., France.

"If your German counterpart says he completely disagrees, you may be on the verge of a highly enjoyable debate."

on the verge of (something): close to achieving something; close to making or seeing something happen

Three months after starting the video project, the team was on the verge of having a final product to show clients.

"... you may be on the verge of a highly enjoyable debate."

brewing: beginning to form or develop

"If a Peruvian you're negotiating with says he disagrees a little, it might actually mean that a serious problem is brewing."

Grammar tip: The causative "get"

Causatives are verbs that express the idea that a person is doing something for someone else. In a sentence with a causative, the subject causes an action to happen, but the subject does not perform the action himself or herself. Some examples of causatives are get, let, make, have and help.

Get can be used to talk about achieving a certain objective or state, or ensuring that an action is done. The following formula can be used: get + person + to + infinitive.

"Managers are constantly learning that what gets you to [say] 'yes' in one culture gets you to [say] 'no' in another."

More examples:

Anna usually gets suppliers to reduce prices for her company.
Mark, a software salesman, aims to get the clients to upgrade their programs.
The manager will get the department head to review the proposal by this afternoon.

Another formula that can be used is get + object + past participle. In this case, the doer of the action is not mentioned, so the action is emphasized.

Melie got her car fixed yesterday.
Franco will get the garden's grass cut before 7:00 p.m.
The writer gets her feature articles published every month.

For compound subjects
A tag question is a question used after a statement to seek confirmation of the statement. 
 
When there is more than one subject (a compound subject), the pronoun in the question tag follows the pronoun used when the subjects are combined.

You and I should go to the seminar, shouldn't we? (you + I = we)
Michelle and Claudia are both accountants, aren't they? (Michelle + Claudia = they)

When there are two or more verbs (a compound verb), the question tag follows the same rule as when there is only one verb.

Blake can sing and play the guitar, can't he?
Blake sang and played the guitar at the company picnic, didn't he?

For sentences that have two or more subject-verb sets (a compound sentence), the question tag is based on the last subject-verb set.

Hugues is a good teacher, and he taught you well, didn't he?
John and Marla can speak Japanese, but John can’t read it, can he?

A tag question is a question used after a statement to seek confirmation of the statement. Here are the rules for forming tag questions:

For complex sentences, the tag question is based on the independent clause.
Before we can enter the exhibit, we'll need to buy tickets, won't we?
 
For compound-complex sentences, the question tag is based on the last independent clause.
I plan to visit Japan a month from now, but I'll have to file the leave right away, won't I?

___________________

The question tag "won't you" is used to invite somebody to do something.

Sit down, won't you?
Have some coffee, won't you?

For suggestions that include yourself, begin the imperative with "let's" and add "shall we?"

Let's sit down, shall we?
Let's have some coffee, shall we?

"Would you" is for polite commands.

Get me something to drink, would you?
Send him an email, would you?

"Can you" is for friendly commands. It is less formal.

Pick up the phone, can you?
Carry this bag, can you?

"Will you" and "can't you" are less friendly and less polite.

Be quiet, will you?
Work faster, can't you?

"Will you" is the only question tag used with negative imperatives.

Don’t tell anybody, will you?
Don't get mad, will you?

Imperatives can have question tags. The question tags would allow the speaker to:

invite somebody to do something
Sit down, won't you?
 
make suggestions
Let's sit down, shall we?
 
make commands or requests
Get me something to drink, would you?
Don’t tell anybody, will you?

___________________________

Reflexive pronouns show that the person who does the action is the same person who receives the action.

He cut himself when he was slicing vegetables.
She bought herself a new dress.

When the reflexive pronoun follows the preposition "by," it means that the action was done by the subject/s and nobody/nothing else.

I painted the house by myself. I did it in two weeks.
We worked on this report by ourselves. Our boss was on a business trip.

Intensive pronouns emphasize a noun or a pronoun.

I don't want to talk to the CEO's assistant. I want to talk to the CEO herself.

Unlike reflexive pronouns, intensive pronouns can be removed from a sentence without making the sentence lose its meaning.

He asked his team to come early, but he himself arrived late.

# Present perfect vs simple past

The present perfect tense says that the subject possesses ("has") a past experience. The simple past tense simply says that the subject did an action in the past.

I have studied the trends in the market.
I studied the trends in the market.

The present perfect tense expresses that an action started in an unspecified or unknown time in the past and has not yet been completed. It is also used with adverbs such as "just", "already," "recently," "yet", etc. The simple past tense expresses that an action began in the past and ended in the past.

My English has improved since I moved to Australia.
(My English is still getting better every day.)

My English improved when I moved to Australia.
(My English is not improving anymore.)

The present perfect tense can also be used to express that an action is finished but still affects the present. The simple past tense expresses that the past action is not connected to the present.

We have hired only eight new sales agents. We need to hire two more.
We hired eight new sales agents last week.

In its negative form, the present perfect tense talks about an action or event that you expected but didn't happen. In its negative form, the simple past tense talks about an action that didn't happen.

I thought my English would improve when I moved to Australia, but it hasn't.

How to form a mixed third and second conditional
The mixed third and second conditional sentence is formed by combining CONDITION ("if" + "had" + past participle) + RESULT ("would" + base verb).

If you had learned English, you would feel more confident about speaking at the conference.

The mixed third and second conditional indicates that if a past action had been different, the present result would be different as well.

(Past action: John did not finish his work. Present result: He needs to rush today.)

If I had not prepared for this negotiation, I would be very anxious about the results.
(Past action: I prepared for the negotiation. Present result: I am not anxious about the results.)
________________________

The mixed third and second conditional is also called "the blame conditional." It indicates a past action as the cause of a present result, which may be good or bad.

A mixed third and second conditional sentence takes the form CONDITION ("if" + "had" + past participle) + RESULT ("would" + base verb).

The mixed second and third conditional says that if a present situation were NOT true, the past action would have been different.

If John did not love his job, he would have quit a long time ago.

Present situation: John loves his job.
Past action: He did not quit his job.

If Nellie had her smartphone, she would have called you already.

Present situation: Nelli doesn't have her smartphone with her.

"In case" is a conjunction that connects clauses together.

"In case" expresses precaution – doing things in order to be ready for possible future situations.

I brought an umbrella in case it rains.
Please call me before our meeting in case I forget.

"Unless" is another conjunction that is used to connect clauses.

"Unless" expresses a negative condition – an action will be done if the condition is not true. It is usually followed by a verb in the simple present tense.

We will get to the airport before our flight unless traffic is bad.
Let's hire the first applicant unless we find better candidates.

"Unless" can also be followed by a verb in the simple past or the past perfect tense, depending on the type of conditional used. It is never followed by a verb in the future tense.

Vincent will be there by 9:00 -- unless his  flight is delayed. (first conditional)
I wouldn't fire Carl unless I had a replacement for him. (second conditional)
They wouldn't have won the account unless they had worked very hard on the preliminary research. (third conditional)  

We use the conjunctions "in case" and "unless" to connect clauses together.

"In case" is used to express precaution.
"Unless" is used to express a negative condition.
________________________________

Remember

“Remember” means to keep a person or thing in your mind or to bring a person or thing back to your mind. Think of “remember” as the opposite of “forget.” Listen to some examples:

I just remembered I left the water on.

Remember to bring a lock to store your belongings.

In the first example, notice that “remember” is followed by a clause. In the second, it is followed by an infinitive, also known as to + verb. “Remember” can also be followed by a noun that ends in -ing, as in “I remember leaving the water on.”

Remind

Now, let’s talk about “remind.”

“Remind” means to cause someone else to remember something. In other words, a person can make sure someone else does not forget something. Listen to an example:

Can you remind him to buy more cat food? We ran out.

When we use “remind” this way, the verb is followed by an object. In this case, the object is “him.”

Another way we use “remind” is to say that a similarity causes us to think of someone or something. Listen to an example:

That actor reminds me so much of my brother. They have the same eyes and laugh.

When we use “remind” this way, we always include the word “of.”

The past perfect continuous tense is used when describing how long a past action had been in progress when another past event occurred.

She had been trying to call him for an hour before her call finally got through.
Mr. Santiago had been running the company for 55 years when he retired in 1988.

The past perfect continuous tense can be used to describe a past action that had been -- but no longer is -- in progress, and caused a past result.

He was unable to go to work this morning. He had been watching movies all night last night.
They celebrated last night. They had been working hard on a special account since November.

When describing an event that occurred before another event, we can use two tenses: the past perfect continuous and the past perfect.

We use the past perfect continuous when the duration of the action is given, e.g. "for an hour," "for 55 years."

We use the past perfect tense if the duration of the action is not given. This changes the meaning of the sentence.

He was unable to go to work this morning. He had watched movies last night.
(This does not explain why he could not go to work. He could have simply watched two movies from 6 p.m. until midnight.)

They celebrated last night. They had worked hard on a special account.
(This says that they celebrated because they completed work on a special account. It gives no hint as to how long they worked on it. For all we know, the project was difficult but was completed in only one day.)

The past perfect continuous tense is formed by combining: "had been" + verb + "-ing."

We use the past perfect continuous tense to:

Describe how long a past action had been in progress when another past event occurred.
Describe a past action that had been -- but no longer is -- in progress and caused a past result.

## Present participle vs. past participle

- Present participle
Participles are words that look like verbs but are used as adjectives.

The present participle ends in -ing. It describes the state of an object, or what an object is used for.

The water sparkles; it is sparkling water.
This water is for drinking; it is drinking water.

- Past participle
The past participle takes the perfect form of the verb, e.g., "taken," "gone," "been." It describes the action that was done to the object.

John edited the draft of this report last night. This is an edited report.
That's the approved budget. The officers discussed and approved it yesterday.

Compare the examples below:

The story bores me. It's a boring story. I am bored.

That magic trick amazed the crowd. It's an amazing trick. The amazed crowd applauded.

I used a washing machine to wash these clothes. Here are the washed shirts.

The teacher prepared an interesting lesson. The interested students discussed it for a long time.

__________________________

- Borrow
To "borrow" something means to get something from someone and return it to the owner after a period of time.

Can I borrow that file, please?
I need to borrow a book from the library.

- lend 

When you "lend" something, it means that you are the owner of an object. You are giving the object to someone, but you expect him or her to return it to you after a period of time.

It's raining outside. I can lend you my umbrella.
You might be late for the meeting. I will lend you my car.

- How to use borrow and lend in a sentence
You can use "borrow" and "lend" when you want to get something from someone for a period of time. Study the examples below.

Can I borrow your stapler? / Can you lend me your stapler?
May I borrow your laptop? / Can you lend me your laptop?

You can use "borrow" and "lend" when making an offer to give something to someone for a period of time. Study the examples below.

Would you like to borrow some money? / Would you like me to lend you some money?
If you need to make a phone call, you can borrow my phone. / If you need to make a phone call, I can lend you my phone.

"Borrow" and "lend" are verbs that are often used in the same context.

"Borrow" means to get something from someone and return it to the owner after a period of time.

Can I borrow that file, please?

When you lend something, it means that you are the owner of an object.

I can lend you my umbrella.

___________________________

## THAT vs. WHICH

"That”and "which" introduce clauses that provide information about a noun.

"That" introduces a restrictive clause, or a clause that contains essential information about a noun. It differentiates a noun from other nouns similar to it. A "that" clause cannot be removed from the sentence without changing its meaning.

The iPad that will be released in August will cost a thousand dollars, while the iPad that will be released in December will cost half that price.
(The sentence says there are two iPads - one to be released in August and one to be released in December.)

Removing the clauses introduced by "that" will make the sentence meaningless.

The iPad will cost a thousand dollars while the iPad will cost half that price.

"Which" introduces a non-restrictive clause, or a clause that contains additional information about a noun. It can be removed from the sentence without changing its meaning.

The iPad, which will be released in August, will cost a thousand dollars.
(The sentence says there is only one iPad.)  

Removing the clause introduced by "which" does not change the meaning of the sentence.

The iPad will cost a thousand dollars.


"That" is not preceded by a comma. "Which" should be preceded by a comma. However, people habitually use "which" when they mean "that." If this is the case, "which" should not be preceded by a comma.

"That" and "which" introduce clauses that provide information about a noun.

1998 se decía “nineteen ninety-eight”, 1987 era “nineteen eighty-seven”

||||
|-|-|-|
|2018|	2009|
Inglés británico	|Two thousand and eighteen	|Two thousand and nine
Inglés americano|	Two thousand eighteen	|Two thousand nine
En forma de dos números	|Twenty eighteen	|(poco frecuente) Twenty -“o”- nine

el 2000 es simplemente “the year two thousand”.

El milenio anterior

Como hemos mencionado más arriba, la gran mayoría de los años del pasado milenio se expresan en la forma sencilla de dos números:

1998	Nineteen ninety-eight
1863	Eighteen sixty-three
1066	Ten sixty-six

Cuando el año termina en dos ceros (como 1900 o 1500).
En ese caso, se expresa en forma de centenas:

1900	Nineteen hundred
1500	Fifteen hundred

Fíjate en que la palabra “hundred” se utiliza en singular, sin “s” al final. A algunos alumnos les resulta extraño referirse a centenas cuando hablamos de números por encima del millar. Sin embargo, es bastante corriente en inglés. Por ejemplo, al hablar de dinero podemos expresar la cantidad “€1200” como “one thousand, two hundred euros”, o igualmente como “twelve hundred euros”. También es necesario emplear esta última forma cuando nos referimos a los cien años que 

Cuando el año tiene un cero en la penúltima posición (por ejemplo, 1908, 1804).
Aquí hay dos posibilidades, aunque la primera está mucho más difundida:
||||
|-|-|-|
||Pronunciar el cero como la letra “o” (igual que la “o” de la palabra “phone”, que fonéticamente es /əʊ/)|	Utilizar la forma:____ hundred and _____ (poco frecuente)
1908	|Nineteen - “o” - eight	|Nineteen hundred and eight
1804	|Eighteen - “o” - four	|Eighteen hundred and four

Antes del año 1000

Una vez más, no hay un consenso claro sobre cómo expresar los años de esta época (por ejemplo el 821 o el 453). Hay dos opciones principales, aunque la segunda solo se usa en inglés británico:
||||
|-|-|-|
||Decir la primera cifra y después el resto como un número de dos cifras	|Decir el número entero pero precedido de la expresión “the year”
821	|Eight twenty-one	|The year eight hundred and twenty one
453	|Four fifty-three	|The year four hundred and fifty three

A participial phrase is a past or present participle with a set of other words.

A participial phrase functions as an adjective; it is used to modify the noun closest to it in a sentence.

The lady serving our food is very pleasant.
The food served in this restaurant is delicious.
Wanting to earn a lot of tips, she did her job quickly and well.
Cooked only after the order is given, the food here is always served hot.

A participial phrase is a past or present participle with a set of other words. It is used as an adjective to describe the noun closest to it in a sentence.

Walking through the park, George admired the scenery.

Some participial phrases use conjunctions at the beginning.

____________________

## Correcting incorrectly placed modifiers

A participial phrase that is either placed in the wrong part of a sentence or written in the wrong way so that it modifies the wrong noun is called a dangling modifier.

When implemented carefully, misunderstandings can be prevented by communication strategies.

This sounds as if misunderstandings, not communication strategies, must be implemented carefully.  To correct this dangling modifier, we can move the noun being modified closer to the participial phrase:

Communication strategies, when implemented carefully, can prevent misunderstandings.

Sometimes, the noun modified by the participial phrase is not in the sentence.

While waiting for the client's feedback, there was nothing else to do but read and reply to emails.

To correct this dangling modifier, we need to add the correct noun and put the participial phrase beside it:

While waiting for the client's feedback, we had nothing else to do but read and reply to emails.

A dangling modifier is an error in sentence structure in which the modifier is placed in the wrong part of a sentence, or the noun modified by the participial phrase is not present.

Incorrect:
When implemented carefully, misunderstandings can be prevented by communication strategies.

Correct:
Communication strategies, when implemented carefully, can prevent misunderstandings.

# Dangling modifiers

Correcting incorrectly placed modifiers
A participial phrase that is either placed in the wrong part of a sentence or written in the wrong way so that it modifies the wrong noun is called a dangling modifier.

When implemented carefully, misunderstandings can be prevented by communication strategies.

This sounds as if misunderstandings, not communication strategies, must be implemented carefully.  To correct this dangling modifier, we can move the noun being modified closer to the participial phrase:

Communication strategies, when implemented carefully, can prevent misunderstandings.

Sometimes, the noun modified by the participial phrase is not in the sentence.

While waiting for the client's feedback, there was nothing else to do but read and reply to emails.

To correct this dangling modifier, we need to add the correct noun and put the participial phrase beside it:

While waiting for the client's feedback, we had nothing else to do but read and reply to emails.
A dangling modifier is an error in sentence structure in which the modifier is placed in the wrong part of a sentence, or the noun modified by the participial phrase is not present.

Incorrect:
When implemented carefully, misunderstandings can be prevented by communication strategies.

Correct:
Communication strategies, when implemented carefully, can prevent misunderstandings.

An adjective is usually placed before the word it describes.

An adjective can come after the word it describes. It follows a form of the verb "to be."

After the verb "to be":

The meeting was short.
Their manager is kind.
The employee is new.

After other verbs:

My colleague looks tired.
The client seemed upset.
The news sounded bad.

An adjective used in this way can show how something sounds, smells, tastes, feels, looks or seems.

An adverb is a word that often ends in -ly.

An adverb can describe a verb.

The assistant speaks carefully.

An adverb can also describe another adverb.

The job is difficult. (the adjective “difficult” describes the noun “job”)

An adverb describes a verb, an adjective, or another adverb.

His emails are usually brief. (the adverb “usually” describes the adjective “brief”)

REMEMBER: There are adjectives that end in -ly, such as:

costly

These are NOT adverbs.

An adjective describes nouns like people, places or objects. It can be used in two ways:

adjective + noun

Grammar tip: The zero and third conditional

Conditionals are sentences used to discuss hypothetical situations, and their effects or consequences. A conditional usually includes a conditional clause, also known as the if-clause.

"If I ask you, 'Do you want $50 or $100?' -- you take the $100, no regrets."

The third conditional, also known as the "past conditional," is used when talking about imaginary situations in the past. It is formed by combining the condition (if + past perfect) and the result (would + have + past participle.)

"But if she had stuck with music, she would never have met her husband."

More examples:

If it rains heavily, the town's streets get flooded.
Trixie saves $10 if she buys the cheaper pair of shoes.
If Paula had chosen a different shirt, her outfit would not have looked good.
Carlo would have finished the report if he had spent a few more hours in the office.

# Verbals: gerunds, infinitives and participles

Verbals are words that look like verbs but are used as nouns, adjectives or adverbs.  There are three kinds of verbals: gerunds, infinitives and participles.

## Gerunds
Gerunds are verbals that end in -ing and function as nouns.

Playing basketball takes up much of her time.
He gave up smoking three years ago.
His favorite pastime is watching TV.
I am afraid of flying in an airplane.

## Infinitives
Infinitives are verbals made by combining the word "to" + a verb in its base form. They function as nouns, adjectives, or adverbs.

To play basketball for the Bulls is one of his biggest dreams.
I want to make you proud.
His goal was to run 3 kilometers every day.
Baseball is an interesting game to watch.
## Participles
Participles are verbals used as adjectives. There are two types of participles: present participles and past participles.

Present participles end in -ing.

The book is interesting.
The walking man is very tall.

Past participles end in -ed, -en, -d, -t or -n as in the words "asked," "eaten," "saved," "dealt" and "seen."

His neck was injured.
They put a brace on his injured neck to help it heal.

## Verbs followed by gerunds or infinitives
Some verbs like "begin," "hate," "start," "can't stand," "prefer," "continue", "can't bear," "neglect" and "love" can take either a gerund or an infinitive without changing the meaning of a sentence.

She began working.
She began to work.

With verbs such as "remember," "stop," "try" and "regret," the use of a gerund or an infinitive changes the meaning of a sentence.

I remembered locking the door.(The person carried out the action first and then remembered doing it.)
I remembered to lock the door.(The person speaking remembered they had to lock the door and then carried out the action.)

Other verbs only take one form or the other. Unfortunately, there is no rule about which form the verb takes. The same is true when the verb follows an adjective. The best way to learn their correct use is with practice.

______________

get into (something): to become interested or involved in something, such as an industry, hobby or activity

After attending a free lesson with a friend, Violet started to get into yoga.

"'Why did you think that you could get into space? Rockets?'"

physics: a branch of science that deals with the movement of forces such as natural heat, light and energy, as well as their relationships with objects

A person who is familiar with physics can explain how white light can be split into many different colors.

"He has the same degrees I have, which are in physics and economics."

economics: a field of study that deals with the production and sale of goods and services

Business owners use the principles of economics to determine how much to charge customers for products and services.

"He has the same degrees I have, which are in physics and economics."

aerospace: an industry that involves travel in or above the Earth's atmosphere, as well as the vehicles used for this

SpaceX is an aerospace company that builds rockets with a goal of taking humans to the planet Mars.

"Traditional space assumed, like aerospace, that there was one customer and the customer was the government."

notion: an idea, concept or opinion

Archie found the discussion confusing; afterwards, he had only a vague notion of what conclusion had been reached.

"... the customer had a finite amount of demand and the customer was going to pay you whatever it cost plus a little bit of profit. And this is the notion of cost-plus accounting."

incentive: something that motivates a person to put more effort into an activity, or to do something in a certain way

The manager offered an incentive to his team: the first three people to finish their tasks would be allowed to go home early.

"... there is very little incentive to lower your cost ..."

bureaucracy: a system or organization of people that is used to make decisions or accomplish tasks in a business or government; this may involve going through complicated or tedious procedures

Due to the slow and complex bureaucracy of the land development office, the necessary permits were released later than planned.

"I could charge less because I have less bureaucracy."

closing in on (something): moving nearer to something, whether physically or otherwise

The company's stock prices went up today, closing in on a seven percent increase.

"... he dropped the cost of launch by almost, by a factor of six, closing in on factor ten."

Grammar tip: Verbs followed by infinitives

An infinitive is a form of verb that can function as a noun, adjective or adverb. An infinitive takes the form to + the base form of a verb.

Some verbs are often followed by infinitives. There are no fixed rules about which verbs are followed by infinitives, but speakers can achieve correct usage through exposure and practice.

"... the customer was going to pay you whatever it cost plus a little bit of profit."

"I will just choose to charge less."

"I probably need to update these slides ..."

More examples:

David preferred to ride his bicycle to work rather than take public transportation.
The siblings chose to hold the family reunion in a hotel.
