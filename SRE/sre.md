Below, you’ll find our selection of the top 20 interview questions for site reliability engineers. We’ve also provided sample answers and guidelines to help you assess candidates' expertise and their potential fit for the role, even if you don’t have the same level of technical knowledge as them. 

1. Describe a script you've developed to solve a problem. What language did you use and why?

Although this question focuses on the solution rather than on the problem, the first thing candidates should do is to give you context, i.e. explain the problem they faced.

The best applicants will then explain how they considered additional requirements, as well as the need for scalability and maintainability of their script. Then, they’ll provide details about the language they chose and why. For example: 

Python for its simplicity and rich libraries, or 

JavaScript for its asynchronous capabilities, or

Go for its efficiency and performance

2. How do you ensure your code is clean, maintainable, and efficient?
Skilled candidates will be deeply familiar with the importance of clean code. Look for specific best practices they mention. For example, they might explain that they: 

Write modular code

Use clear and meaningful variable names

Implement consistent coding styles

Conduct thorough testing with unit tests and integration tests

They might also talk about the importance of code reviews, giving and receiving feedback, and maintaining clear documentation to ensure the codebase is transparent for others. 

Mentioning specific tools like linters or formatters, and principles such as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) or SOLID, indicates a strong understanding of coding best practices.

You can also use our Clean Code test to assess an engineer’s ability to write easy-to-maintain code.

3. What is your experience with using version control systems such as Git?

Expect candidates to describe their proficiency with Git or similar systems through specific examples, such as:

Branching and merging

Handling merge conflicts

Collaborating with team members

Knowledge of advanced features like rebase, cherry-pick, and tagging is a plus. Their answers should also demonstrate an understanding of best practices for integrating version control into CI/CD pipelines.

4. What is multithreading?

Multithreading is the ability of a CPU to execute multiple threads concurrently, each thread running a part of a program. 

A good answer would outline the benefits of multithreading, such as improved application performance and responsiveness, and its challenges, like the complexity of thread synchronization and potential for deadlocks. 

Expect skilled applicants to give you examples of using multithreading in past projects and be familiar with synchronization mechanisms, such as mutexes or semaphores.

5. Explain the difference between a process and a thread in a Linux system.

The difference between the two is that: 

A process is an instance of a running program with its own dedicated memory space

A thread is the smallest unit of processing that can be scheduled by an operating system

Threads operate within a process and share its memory space. 

6. Describe how you would use cgroups in Linux for resource management.

Skilled candidates will explain that cgroups (control groups) allow for the allocation, prioritization, and monitoring of system resources like CPU time, system memory, network bandwidth, or combinations of these resources among user-defined groups of tasks. 

They may describe past situations where they've used cgroups, for example to:

Limit resource hogging by certain processes

Ensure critical services have enough resources

Manage containerized applications efficiently

Use our Linux test to evaluate candidates’ proficiency in this operating system.

7. How do you monitor system performance? What tools do you use?

A comprehensive approach to system performance monitoring features a variety of tools, such as: 

System-level monitors like top, htop, vmstat

Application performance monitoring (APM) tools

Logging tools

Some more advanced solutions are: 

Prometheus for metric collection and alerting

Grafana for dashboards

ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for log aggregation and visualization

Skilled candidates might also explain that monitoring should not just be reactive, i.e. fixing issues as they arise, but also proactive, identifying potential issues before they impact users.

8. Explain the differences between NFS and SAN storage solutions.

Look for answers explaining that: 

NFS (Network File System) is a protocol allowing remote access to files over a network, presenting storage at the file level

SAN (Storage Area Network) is a specialized, high-speed network that gives access to consolidated, block-level storage

NFS is often used for sharing files across a network of devices, making it suitable for situations where ease of access and file sharing are a priority, while SAN is typically used in environments requiring high performance, such as databases, where direct access to the disk block is necessary. 

9. Explain the difference between UDP and TCP. How does each affect web application performance and reliability?

Expect answers to cover that: 

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a connection-oriented protocol that ensures reliable and ordered delivery of a stream of bytes. It's beneficial for applications where data integrity is critical. 

UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a connectionless protocol that offers faster transmissions but without guarantees on delivery or order. It’s suitable for applications where speed is more critical than reliability, like streaming or gaming. 

Candidates might discuss trade-offs, noting how TCP's error correction mechanisms can introduce latency but ensure reliability, whereas UDP's lightweight nature can enhance performance but at the risk of data loss or out-of-order arrival.

10. How do you manage package dependencies and updates in a production environment?

Skilled candidates will talk about strategies such as using virtual environments, containerization, or specific tools (like npm for Node.js or pip for Python) to manage packages. 

They should emphasize the importance of testing updates in a development or staging environment before applying them to production to avoid unexpected downtime. 

11. How do you decide when a task should be automated? What factors do you consider?

The decision whether to automate a task should be based on factors such as:

The task’s frequency and complexity

The potential for errors

The time investment required for automation

Experienced candidates would also consider the impact on the team and whether automating the task would reduce toil or improve efficiency. They might also discuss evaluating the return on investment (ROI) of automation and ensuring that automated processes are documented and maintainable.

12. What’s your experience with configuration management tools?

Expect seasoned SREs to have hands-on experience with tools like Ansible, Chef, Puppet, or SaltStack and to give examples of instances where they've used them to automate the setup and management of software and servers. 

Look for examples of how these tools have helped ensure consistency across environments, facilitated scalability, and improved operational efficiency. 

13. Explain the concept of infrastructure as code (IaC). How can it be applied in managing cloud resources?

IaC is the practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure through code, rather than through manual processes. It enables consistent and repeatable deployment of servers and services with the help of tools such as Terraform, CloudFormation, or Azure Resource Manager templates. 

Application examples might include:

Automating the creation of cloud environments

Scaling resources based on demand

Ensuring compliance with security policies

You can use TestGorilla’s Terraform test to evaluate candidates’ proficiency with it, or add some of our Terraform interview questions to go a step further.

14. What specific strategies do you use to make your automation scripts maintainable and scalable?

Look for answers that mention the importance of readability, modularity, and reusability of code when discussing automation scripts and how to maintain them. 

For this, site reliability engineers might: 

Use version control for scripts

Document the code and its purpose

Apply consistent naming conventions

Break down scripts into smaller, manageable functions or modules

To ensure scalability, they would need to create scripts that can handle variable loads and environments dynamically. 

Candidates might also explain how they've used parameters, environment variables, or configuration files to adapt scripts to different scenarios and needs. Insights into testing strategies, such as unit tests or integration tests for automation scripts, are a plus. 

15. How do you approach cost optimization for cloud resources?

To optimize the costs of cloud resources, SREs would need to: 

Analyze current and projected costs with tools provided by cloud platforms

Use autoscaling to adjust resources based on demand

Select the right types and sizes of resources (e.g., compute instances) for the task at hand

Use spot instances or reserved instances where appropriate

Set up budget alerts to monitor and control expenses

Skilled applicants will also mention that different deployment architectures, such as serverless deployments or containers, also impact costs.

16. Explain the differences between IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS. When would you use each?
Look for answers that outline the following differences and use cases: 

IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) provides virtualized computing resources online. It’s best used for custom, scalable computing environments. AWS EC2 is an example.

PaaS (Platform as a Service) offers a platform where customers can develop, run, and manage applications without building and maintaining the infrastructure. Examples include Heroku and Google App Engine.

SaaS (Software as a Service) is a software distribution model in which service providers host applications and make them available to customers over the internet. Examples include Salesforce, Docusign, Zelt, and even TestGorilla.

17. Tell us about your experience with containerization and orchestration in the cloud. Have you used Kubernetes or similar tools?

Skilled applicants will be proficient in containerization technologies like Docker and orchestration tools like Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, or Amazon ECS. Look for examples where candidates have successfully used these tools to improve deployment speed, reliability, and scalability. 

Candidates might also talk about container registries, continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), and managing containerized workloads at scale.

Use TestGorilla’s Docker and Kubernetes tests to evaluate SREs’ ability to work independently with each tool.  

18. Describe the difference between logging, monitoring, and tracing. How does each contribute to observability?

Expect candidates to explain that: 

Logging is the recording of discrete events that happen in the system

Monitoring is the continuous collection and analysis of metrics to assess system health

Tracing is tracking the execution path of requests to diagnose problems or performance bottlenecks

The three practices enhance observability by collecting data on system performance and behavior, helping identify issues and inform the team’s decisions.

19. Define the concepts of SLI, SLO, and SLA. How do they interrelate in the context of SRE?
Candidates should explain that:

Service Level Indicators (SLIs) are specific, measurable characteristics of the service, such as latency or error rate

Service Level Objectives (SLOs) are the target values for SLIs that the service aims to meet

Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are contractual agreements with customers that include consequences for not meeting SLOs

Skilled SREs will understand how these concepts help to set, measure, and manage the performance and reliability of services. 


20. How do you set up thresholds for alerts?

The best candidates will know how to set up alert thresholds that balance information and noise. Expect them to talk about analyzing the normal operating ranges of systems and services and looking into historical performance data.

Candidates should also mention the practice of simultaneously using static thresholds for fixed values, and dynamic thresholds, which adjust based on trends or patterns. 

For example, they might set static thresholds for critical system resources, such as 90% disk space usage, to prevent service disruption. As for dynamic thresholds, they could use them for metrics like CPU usage, where normal ranges might vary depending on the time of day or workload.

# SRE VS DEVOps VS Platfomr

## SRE overview

Site reliability engineering (SRE) is a practice that focuses on improving and maintaining the reliability of a software system. It utilizes software tools and automated tasks like application monitoring and reliability tasks to accomplish that.
The responsibilities of SRE teams include:

Application monitoring
Emergency response
Change management
Ensuring the availability, efficiency and performance standards of applications

## DevOps 

Devops teams work in collaboration to automate and streamline the software development process. DevOps greatly benefits teams by improving collaboration, communication, software delivery speed and quality. Responsibilities of DevOps engineers include:

Prioritizing communication and collaboration.
Automating processes.
System monitoring.
Optimizing system performance.
Troubleshooting issues.

## platform 

Platform engineering is a rising discipline in the cloud-native era. It aims to build toolchains and workflows covering the operational needs of the entire software development lifecycle, enabling self-service infrastructure capabilities.

Platform engineers & PE teams might focus on developing things like build tools, version control systems and automated testing frameworks. They also build some workflows, such as CI/CD, alerting, and deployment workflows. These processes help software developers build and deliver software more efficiently. Platform engineers are responsible for:

Developing toolchains and workflows.
Ensuring the security and compliance of infrastructure.
Managing infrastructure reliability and scalability.
Educating developers on best practices and platform usage.

# SRE vs. DevOps: Comparing, contrasting

What are the similarities between DevOps and SRE? SRE and DevOps teams have a lot in common:

Focus on automation. SRE and DevOps both encourage automation, communication and collaboration. Both teams bear responsibilities like monitoring, optimizing system performance and troubleshooting issues. 
Communication & collaboration. Both DevOps and SRE encourage communication and collaboration between development and operations teams as a core principle. It helps them deliver high-quality and reliable software.
Tools. SRE and DevOps teams are responsible for production monitoring and troubleshooting. They frequently use log analysis and monitoring tools like Splunk, Grafana and NewRelic to identify issues and improve the performance of software systems.
Metrics. Both SRE and DevOps teams monitor metrics that reflect the behavior of applications and systems. Even if there are separate metrics, some metrics are useful for both teams. For example, response times, error rates and other failure metrics help detect and resolve issues before they impact users.

But how SRE and DevOps differ is quite illuminating:

- Primary focus
Of course, there are some primary differences between them, too. The first major difference is the breadth of the focus. DevOps focuses on the entire software development process, while SRE narrowly focuses on the reliability and scalability of a system. Of course, in SRE’s case, that narrow focus can have a significant berth in practice, as system reliability can touch a lot of disparate areas.

- Cultural changes
DevOps breaks down silos between the development and operations teams, facilitating a collaborative and non-siloed culture. The main focus of SRE is to establish a culture of reliability and accountability.

- Incident response
DevOps teams focus on preventing incidents from occurring in the first place through tasks such as automated software development, testing and proactive monitoring. In contrast, SREs focus on investigating the root cause of incidents and implementing measures to prevent them from happening again.


- Metrics
DevOps teams focus on DORA metrics such as deployment frequency, lead time for changes, mean time to resolution (MTTR), and change failure rate. In contrast SRE teams focus on metrics such as latency, traffic, uptime, error rates, and service level agreements (SLAs).

# Understanding SLA, SLO, SLI and Error Budgets

## SLA: The Promise service level agreement

It’s a formal agreement between a service provider and the end user that defines the level of service expected, like system uptime or response time.

So to have an SLA defined you need to have

Service Provider
Service User
Service
Metric

The Service Provider, provides service to a service user and specifies the commitment to provide the service as per the defined metrics over a period of time. This offer has to be agreed by the service user. A formal agreement is then termed as SLA.

## SLO service level objective

SLOs are the specific goals set by a provider to achieve the standards set in the SLA.

## SLI: Measuring the Service

Service Level Indicators (SLIs) are the metrics used to measure the service’s performance against the SLO.

SLIs could be the actual uptime percentage or the average response time of a system.

## Error Budgets

In IT, an Error Budget is the amount of time services can be down without breaching the SLA. It’s a crucial part of reliability engineering, allowing teams to balance innovation and reliability.

The error budget is essentially the amount of time a service is allowed to be unavailable or not meeting the SLO before it breaches the SLA.

This error budget represents the amount of additional downtime you can afford without breaching the SLA, given that you’re aiming to meet the SLO. It’s a buffer that allows for some level of imperfection in service delivery while still maintaining the overall agreement with the client or user.
