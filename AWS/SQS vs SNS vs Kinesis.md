# SQS:
- Consumer “pull data”
- Data is deleted after being
consumed
- Can have as many workers
(consumers) as we want
- No need to provision
throughput
- Ordering guarantees only on
FIFO queues
- Individual message delay
capability

# SNS:
- Push data to many
subscribers
- Up to 12,500,000 subscribers
- Data is not persisted (lost if
not delivered)
- Pub/Sub
- Up to 100,000 topics
- No need to provision
throughput
- Integrates with SQS for fan-
out architecture pattern
- FIFO capability for SQS FIFO

# Kinesis:
- Standard: pull data
- 2 MB per shard
- Enhanced-fan out: push data
- 2 MB per shard per consumer
- Possibility to replay data
- Meant for real-time big data,
analytics and ETL
- Ordering at the shard level
- Data expires after X days
- Provisioned mode or on-
demand capacity mode
