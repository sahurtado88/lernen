Users could indeed authorize Access in API Gateway to ensure security. IAM is connected to a gateway that offers resources like AWS credentials.
16. What steps are required in working with API Gateway and AWS Lambda?
The steps involved in using API Gateway and AWS Lambda are as follows:

HTTP Gateway
IAM role creation for permission
AWS Lambda function creation
Develop an API Gateway
Lambda function and API Gateway integration
Data transmission to API Gateway

17. Describe a resource.
A resource is a typed object that belongs to our API domain. Each resource has a data model, connections to other resources, the ability to respond to requests using various methods, and the ability to define assets as variables to thwart requests for several child resources.

18. AWS Lambda Function: What Is It?
Amazon offers AWS Lambda, which is used to upload codes or business logic to the Aws platform and also manages it. This uploading code is referred to as a Lambda Function, and we can use it as an event-driven service that is triggered by changes to data in an S3 bucket or a Dynamodb table, for example, as an AWS API gateway's backend.

19. How can we build HTTP APIs using API Gateway?
HTTP APIs are made for cost-effective, low-latency integrations with services, including HTTP endpoints and AWS Lambda.

Additionally, HTTP claims to support CORS and automatic deployments, as well as OIDC and OAuth authorization.

REST APIs from earlier generations currently offer more options.

With less latency and expenditure than RESTAPIs, HTTP APIs make it possible to build RESTful APIs.

Additionally, it aids in having to send requests to any routing protocol HTTP endpoints from AWS Lambda functions.

Additionally, we are able to develop an HTTP API that works with AWS lambda on the function.

20. How are API Gateway APIs called?
The app developer assists with working with the executeapi API Gateway Service component, which is used to invoke API that has been created or implemented in an API Gateway. There are various ways to call an API and these underpinning programming entities are revealed by the created API.

1. What kinds of API are there?
Two categories of API exist:

It is necessary for API proxy features and API management features in a single solution, and API Gateway also provides REST APIs. RESTful APIs are used to optimize serverless caseloads and HTTP backends using HTTP APIs.

Applications for real-time, two-way communication, such as chat apps and broadcasting dashboards, are built using WEBSOCKET APIs.

Additionally, it keeps a steady connection to handle message transfers between our clients and our backend service.

2. How to troubleshoot the AWS/ApiGateway 5XXError in AWS API Gateway & Lambda?
To enable API Gateway to force logs to CloudWatch, we must create an IAM role:
```
{

    "Version": "2012-10-17",

    "Statement": [

        {

            "Effect": "Allow",

            "Action": [

                "logs:CreateLogGroup",

                "logs:CreateLogStream",

                "logs:DescribeLogGroups",

                "logs:DescribeLogStreams",

                "logs:PutLogEvents",

                "logs:GetLogEvents",

                "logs:FilterLogEvents"

            ],

            "Resource": "*"

        }

    ]
```

3. How can API Gateway and SQS be combined?
The setting for the method is as follows:

```
PostMethod:

    Type: "AWS::ApiGateway::Method"

    Properties:

      ApiKeyRequired: "true"

      HttpMethod: "POST"

      ResourceId: !Ref "SomeResource"

      RestApiId: !Ref "SomeRestApi"

      Integration:

        IntegrationHttpMethod: "POST"

        IntegrationResponses:

        - StatusCode: 200

        Type: "AWS"

        Uri: "arn:aws:apigateway:${AWS::Region}:sqs:action/SendMessage"
```

4. What distinguishes Lambda from the AWS Gateway API?
The URI for the endpoint to be called is AWS API Gateway. Unlike Lambda, which is the calculated function called from S3,  API Gateway or SNS.

5. Can we track calls to the Amazon API Gateway?
You can use the metrics dashboard provided by API Gateway to track calls made to your services after an API has been published and is being used. Through the integration of Amazon CloudWatch, the API Gateway dashboard offers you backend performance metrics for API calls, latency information, and error rates. In addition to receiving error, access, or debug logs in CloudWatch Logs, you can enable detailed metrics for every method in your APIs.

6. What scenarios allow for the use of HTTP APIs?
Constructing proxy APIs for AWS Lambda or indeed any HTTP endpoint is what HTTP APIs are best for.

Constructing contemporary APIs with OIDC and OAuth 2 authorization

Levels of responsibility that are likely to rise significantly

7. Amazon API Gateway: Why Use It?
Developers can use Amazon API Gateway, a straightforward, adaptable, fully managed, pay-as-you-go service, to build and manage reliable APIs for application back ends. You can focus on developing the core business services by using API Gateway to quickly and affordably launch new services.

8. What is the API lifecycle for Amazon API Gateway?
Every REST API can also have multiple stages when using Amazon API Gateway. Stages are designed to assist with the project cycle of an API; for instance, after your APIs have been built, you can deploy people to a development stage or a production stage when they are ready for use.

9. What does an Amazon API Gateway stage mean?
Stages in Amazon API Gateway are comparable to tags. They specify the route that allows access to the deployment. You could designate a development stage, for instance, and deploy one's cars API there.

10. What does Amazon API Gateway's WebSocket routing entail?
The messages are correctly routed to a particular integration using WebSocket forwarding in Amazon API Gateway. When defining the WebSocket API, you must clearly state a routing key and an integration backend to use. A characteristic in the body text is the routing key. Additionally, for non-matching routing keys, a default integration can be set. For more information on routing, consult the documentation.

11. How do I use the backend service to send messages to clients who are connected?
A special URL, known as the callback URL, is formed for each new client linked to the WebSocket API. This callback URL can be used to communicate with the client from the backend system.

12. What is the largest message size that the WebSocket APIs support?
The largest message size that can be sent is 128 KB. Other restrictions on WebSocket APIs are listed in the documentation.

13. What features are included with API Gateway's HTTP APIs as standard?
OIDC, CORS support and OAuth2 support for authorization and authorization, and stage-based automatic deployments are all features that come standard with HTTP APIs.

14. How can I create an HTTP API by importing an OpenAPI definition?
Using OpenAPI 3, you can import an API definition. Routes, integrations, and API models will be made as a result. 

15. In Amazon API Gateway, can I create HTTPS endpoints?
Yes, only HTTPS endpoints are exposed by all APIs built with Amazon API Gateway. HTTP endpoints that are not encrypted are not supported by Amazon API Gateway. By default, Amazon API Gateway gives the API an internal domain that uses the Amazon API Gateway certificate automatically.

16. What types of data are supported by Amazon API Gateway?
For REST,HTTP and WebSocket APIs, APIs built on Amazon API Gateway could indeed accept whatever payloads sent over HTTPS. XML, JSON, query string parameters, and request headers are examples of common data formats.

17. What does an Amazon API Gateway resource mean?
A resource is a worded object that belongs to the domain of your API. Each resource may be linked to other resources, have relationships to certain other resources, and be responsive to various methods. Resources can also be defined as variables to block requests for many child resources.

18. What do Amazon API Gateway stage variables mean?
You can specify key/value pairs of configuration values linked to a stage using stage variables. These values can be included in your API configuration, much like environment variables. Instead of hardcoding the HTTP endpoint for the method integration, you could define it as a stage variable and use it in your API configuration, allowing you to use a distinct endpoint for each stage.

19. What does an Amazon API Gateway resource policy entail?
You can restrict the ability of a specific principal (typically an IAM user or role) to invoke an API by attaching a Resource Policy, a JSON policy document, to the API. You can restrict API calls to specific source IP address variances or CIDR blocks or allow users from different AWS accounts to safely access your API by using a resource policy. In the Amazon API Gateway, resource policies can be combined with REST APIs.

20. What does an Amazon API Gateway Lambda authorizer do?
AWS Lambda functions are called lambda authorizers. Utilizing a bearer token auth strategy, such as OAuth, you can authorize access to APIs with custom request authorizers. When an API is named, API Gateway checks to see if a Lambda authorizer has been set up. If it has, API Gateway then uses the authorization token to call the Lambda function.
