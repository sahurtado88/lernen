# AWS Global Accelerator

- Leverage the AWS internal network to route to your application
- 2 Anycast IP are created for your application
- The Anycast IP send traffic directly to Edge Locations
- The Edge locations send the traffic to your application
- Works with Elastic IP, EC2 instances, ALB, NLB, public or private
- Consistent Performance
    - Intelligent routing to lowest latency and fast regional failover
    - No issue with client cache (because the IP doesnâ€™t change)
    - Internal AWS network
- Health Checks
    - Global Accelerator performs a health check of your applications
    - Helps make your application global (failover less than 1 minute for unhealthy)
    - Great for disaster recovery (thanks to the health checks)
- Security
    - only 2 external IP need to be whitelisted
    - DDoS protection thanks to AWS Shield

## Unicast IP vs Anycast IP
- Unicast IP: one server holds one IP address
- Anycast IP: all servers hold the same IP address and the client is routed to the nearest one


# AWS Global Accelerator vs CloudFront

- They both use the AWS global network and its edge locations around the world
- Both services integrate with AWS Shield for DDoS protection.
## CloudFront
    - Improves performance for both cacheable content (such as images and videos)
    - Dynamic content (such as API acceleration and dynamic site delivery)
    - Content is served at the edge
## Global Accelerator
    - Improves performance for a wide range of applications over TCP or UDP
    - Proxying packets at the edge to applications running in one or more AWS Regions.
    - Good fit for non-HTTP use cases, such as gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT), or Voice over IP
    - Good for HTTP use cases that require static IP addresses
    - Good for HTTP use cases that required deterministic, fast regional failover

________________________
AWS Global Accelerator utilizes the Amazon global network, allowing you to improve the performance of your applications by lowering first-byte latency (the round trip time for a packet to go from a client to your endpoint and back again) and jitter (the variation of latency), and increasing throughput (the amount of time it takes to transfer data) as compared to the public internet.

AWS Global Accelerator improves performance for a wide range of applications over TCP or UDP by proxying packets at the edge to applications running in one or more AWS Regions. Global Accelerator is a good fit for non-HTTP use cases, such as gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT), or Voice over IP, as well as for HTTP use cases that specifically require static IP addresses or deterministic, fast regional failover.
