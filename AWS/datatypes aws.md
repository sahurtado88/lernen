# Database Types
- RDBMS (= SQL / OLTP): RDS, Aurora – great for joins
- NoSQL database – no joins, no SQL : DynamoDB (~JSON), ElastiCache (key /
value pairs), Neptune (graphs), DocumentDB (for MongoDB), Keyspaces (for
Apache Cassandra)
- Object Store: S3 (for big objects) / Glacier (for backups / archives)
- Data Warehouse (= SQL Analytics / BI): Redshift (OLAP), Athena, EMR
- Search: OpenSearch (JSON) – free text, unstructured searches
- Graphs: Amazon Neptune – displays relationships between data
- Ledger: Amazon Quantum Ledger Database
- Time series: Amazon Timestream

# Amazon RDS – Summary
- Managed PostgreSQL / MySQL / Oracle / SQL Server / DB2 / MariaDB / Custom
- Provisioned RDS Instance Size and EBS Volume Type & Size
- Auto-scaling capability for Storage
- Support for Read Replicas and Multi AZ
- Security through IAM, Security Groups, KMS , SSL in transit
- Automated Backup with Point in time restore feature (up to 35 days)
- Manual DB Snapshot for longer-term recovery
- Managed and Scheduled maintenance (with downtime)
- Support for IAM Authentication, integration with Secrets Manager
- RDS Custom for access to and customize the underlying instance (Oracle & SQL Server)
- Use case: Store relational datasets (RDBMS / OLTP), perform SQL queries, transactions

# Amazon Aurora – Summary

- Compatible API for PostgreSQL / MySQL, separation of storage and compute
- Storage: data is stored in 6 replicas, across 3 AZ – highly available, self-healing, auto-scaling
- Compute: Cluster of DB Instance across multiple AZ, auto-scaling of Read Replicas
- Cluster: Custom endpoints for writer and reader DB instances
- Same security / monitoring / maintenance features as RDS
- Know the backup & restore options for Aurora
- Aurora Serverless – for unpredictable / intermittent workloads, no capacity planning
- Aurora Global: up to 16 DB Read Instances in each region, < 1 second storage replication
- Aurora Machine Learning: perform ML using SageMaker & Comprehend on Aurora
- Aurora Database Cloning: new cluster from existing one, faster than restoring a snapshot
- Use case: same as RDS, but with less maintenance / more flexibility / more performance / more features

# Amazon ElastiCache – Summary

- Managed Redis / Memcached (similar offering as RDS, but for caches)
- In-memory data store, sub-millisecond latency
- Select an ElastiCache instance type (e.g., cache.m6g.large)
- Support for Clustering (Redis) and Multi AZ, Read Replicas (sharding)
- Security through IAM, Security Groups, KMS, Redis Auth
- Backup / Snapshot / Point in time restore feature
- Managed and Scheduled maintenance
- Requires some application code changes to be leveraged
- Use Case: Key/Value store, Frequent reads, less writes, cache results for DB
queries, store session data for websites, cannot use SQL.

# Amazon DynamoDB – Summary
- AWS proprietary technology, managed serverless NoSQL database, millisecond latency
- Capacity modes: provisioned capacity with optional auto-scaling or on-demand capacity
- Can replace ElastiCache as a key/value store (storing session data for example, using TTL feature)
- Highly Available, Multi AZ by default, Read and Writes are decoupled, transaction capability
- DAX cluster for read cache, microsecond read latency
- Security, authentication and authorization is done through IAM
- Event Processing: DynamoDB Streams to integrate with AWS Lambda, or Kinesis Data Streams
- Global Table feature: active-active setup
- Automated backups up to 35 days with PITR (restore to new table), or on-demand backups
- Export to S3 without using RCU within the PITR window, import from S3 without using WCU
- Great to rapidly evolve schemas
- Use Case: Serverless applications development (small documents 100s KB), distributed serverless
cache

# Amazon S3 – Summary
- S3 is a… key / value store for objects
- Great for bigger objects, not so great for many small objects
- Serverless, scales infinitely, max object size is 5 TB, versioning capability
- Tiers: S3 Standard, S3 Infrequent Access, S3 Intelligent, S3 Glacier + lifecycle policy
- Features: Versioning, Encryption, Replication, MFA-Delete, Access Logs…
- Security: IAM, Bucket Policies, ACL, Access Points, Object Lambda, CORS, Object/Vault Lock
- Encryption: SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, SSE-C, client-side, TLS in transit, default encryption
- Batch operations on objects using S3 Batch, listing files using S3 Inventory
- Performance: Multi-part upload, S3 Transfer Acceleration, S3 Select
- Automation: S3 Event Notifications (SNS, SQS, Lambda, EventBridge)
- Use Cases: static files, key value store for big files, website hosting
