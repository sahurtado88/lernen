# Load balancer
- Spread load across multiple downstream instances
- Expose a single point of access (DNS) to your application
- Seamlessly handle failures of downstream instances
- Do regular health checks to your instances
- Provide SSL termination (HTTPS) for your websites
- Enforce stickiness with cookies
- High availability across zones
- Separate public traffic from private traffic

# Elastic Load Balancer?
- An Elastic Load Balancer is a managed load balancer
    - AWS guarantees that it will be working
    - AWS takes care of upgrades, maintenance, high availability
    - AWS provides only a few configuration knobs
- It costs less to setup your own load balancer but it will be a lot more effort
on your end
- It is integrated with many AWS offerings / services
    - EC2, EC2 Auto Scaling Groups, Amazon ECS
    - AWS Certificate Manager (ACM), CloudWatch
    - Route 53, AWS WAF, AWS Global Accelerator

# Health Checks
- Health Checks are crucial for Load Balancers
- They enable the load balancer to know if instances it forwards traffic to
are available to reply to requests
- The health check is done on a port and a route (/health is common)
- If the response is not 200 (OK), then the instance is unhealthy

# Types of load balancer on AWS
- AWS has 4 kinds of managed Load Balancers
- Classic Load Balancer (v1 - old generation) – 2009 – CLB
    - HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, SSL (secure TCP)
- Application Load Balancer (v2 - new generation) – 2016 – ALB
    - HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket
- Network Load Balancer (v2 - new generation) – 2017 – NLB
    - TCP, TLS (secure TCP), UDP
- Gateway Load Balancer – 2020 – GWLB
    - Operates at layer 3 (Network layer) – IP Protocol
- Overall, it is recommended to use the newer generation load balancers as they
provide more features
- Some load balancers can be setup as internal (private) or external (public) ELBs

# Classic Load Balancers (v1)

- Supports TCP (Layer 4), HTTP &
HTTPS (Layer 7)
- Health checks are TCP or HTTP
based
- Fixed hostname
XXX.region.elb.amazonaws.com

# Application Load Balancer (v2)

- Application load balancers is Layer 7 (HTTP)
- Load balancing to multiple HTTP applications across machines
(target groups)
- Load balancing to multiple applications on the same machine
(ex: containers)
- Support for HTTP/2 and WebSocket
- Support redirects (from HTTP to HTTPS for example)
- Routing tables to different target groups:
    - Routing based on path in URL (example.com/users & example.com/posts)
    - Routing based on hostname in URL (one.example.com & other.example.com)
    - Routing based on Query String, Headers
    (example.com/users?id=123&order=false)
- ALB are a great fit for micro services & container-based application
(example: Docker & Amazon ECS)
- Has a port mapping feature to redirect to a dynamic port in ECS
- In comparison, we’d need multiple Classic Load Balancer per application

## Application Load Balancer (v2) Target Groups
- EC2 instances (can be managed by an Auto Scaling Group) – HTTP
- ECS tasks (managed by ECS itself) – HTTP
- Lambda functions – HTTP request is translated into a JSON event
- IP Addresses – must be private IPs
- ALB can route to multiple target groups
- Health checks are at the target group level

## Application Load Balancer (v2) Query Strings/Parameters Routing

## Application Load Balancer (v2) Good to Know
- Fixed hostname (XXX.region.elb.amazonaws.com)
- The application servers don’t see the IP of the client directly
    - The true IP of the client is inserted in the header X-Forwarded-For
    - We can also get Port (X-Forwarded-Port) and protocol (X-Forwarded-Proto)

# Network Load Balancer (v2)
- Network load balancers (Layer 4) allow to:
    - Forward TCP & UDP traffic to your instances
    - Handle millions of request per seconds
    - Less latency ~100 ms (vs 400 ms for ALB)
- NLB has one static IP per AZ, and supports assigning Elastic IP
(helpful for whitelisting specific IP)
- NLB are used for extreme performance, TCP or UDP traffic
- Not included in the AWS free tier

## Network Load Balancer – Target Groups
- EC2 instances
- IP Addresses – must be private IPs
- Application Load Balancer
- Health Checks support the TCP, HTTP and HTTPS Protocols

# Gateway Load Balancer
- Deploy, scale, and manage a fleet of 3rd party
network virtual appliances in AWS
- Example: Firewalls, Intrusion Detection and
Prevention Systems, Deep Packet Inspection
Systems, payload manipulation, …
- Operates at Layer 3 (Network Layer) – IP
Packets
- Combines the following functions:
    - Transparent Network Gateway – single
    entry/exit for all traffic
    - Load Balancer – distributes traffic to your virtual appliances
- Uses the GENEVE protocol on port 6081

## Gateway Load Balancer – Target Groups
- EC2 instances
- IP Addresses – must be private IPs

# Sticky Sessions (Session Affinity)
- It is possible to implement stickiness so that the
same client is always redirected to the same
instance behind a load balancer
- This works for Classic Load Balancer,
Application Load Balancer, and Network Load
Balancer
- For both CLB & ALB, the “cookie” used for
stickiness has an expiration date you control
- Use case: make sure the user doesn’t lose his
session data
- Enabling stickiness may bring imbalance to the
load over the backend EC2 instances

## Sticky Sessions – Cookie Names
- Application-based Cookies
    - Custom cookie
        - Generated by the target
        - Can include any custom attributes required by the application
        - Cookie name must be specified individually for each target group
        - Don’t use AWSALB, AWSALBAPP, or AWSALBTG (reserved for use by the ELB)
- Application cookie
    - Generated by the load balancer
    - Cookie name is AWSALBAPP
- Duration-based Cookies
    - Cookie generated by the load balancer
    - Cookie name is AWSALB for ALB, AWSELB for CLB

# Cross-Zone Load Balancing

## With Cross Zone Load Balancing:
each load balancer instance distributes evenly
across all registered instances in all AZ

![alt text](image-61.png)

## Without Cross Zone Load Balancing:
Requests are distributed in the instances of the
node of the Elastic Load Balancer

![alt text](image-62.png)

# Cross-Zone Load Balancing
- Application Load Balancer
    - Enabled by default (can be disabled at the Target Group level)
    - No charges for inter AZ data
- Network Load Balancer & Gateway Load Balancer
    - Disabled by default
    - You pay charges ($) for inter AZ data if enabled
- Classic Load Balancer
    - Disabled by default
    - No charges for inter AZ data if enabled

# Load Balancer - SSL Certificates

- The load balancer uses an X.509 certificate (SSL/TLS server certificate)
- You can manage certificates using ACM (AWS Certificate Manager)
- You can create upload your own certificates alternatively
- HTTPS listener:
    - You must specify a default certificate
    - You can add an optional list of certs to support multiple domains
    - Clients can use SNI (Server Name Indication) to specify the hostname they reach
    - Ability to specify a security policy to support older versions of SSL / TLS (legacy clients)

# SSL – Server Name Indication (SNI)
- SNI solves the problem of loading multiple
SSL certificates onto one web server (to
serve multiple websites)
- It’s a “newer” protocol, and requires the client
to indicate the hostname of the target server
in the initial SSL handshake
- The server will then find the correct
certificate, or return the default one
Note:
- Only works for ALB & NLB (newer
generation), CloudFront
- Does not work for CLB (older gen)

# Elastic Load Balancers – SSL Certificates
- Classic Load Balancer (v1)
    - Support only one SSL certificate
    - Must use multiple CLB for multiple hostname with multiple SSL certificates
- Application Load Balancer (v2)
    - Supports multiple listeners with multiple SSL certificates
    - Uses Server Name Indication (SNI) to make it work
- Network Load Balancer (v2)
    - Supports multiple listeners with multiple SSL certificates
    - Uses Server Name Indication (SNI) to make it work

# Connection Draining (CLB) Deregistration Delay – for ALB & NLB
- Time to complete “in-flight requests” while the
instance is de-registering or unhealthy
- Stops sending new requests to the EC2
instance which is de-registering
- Between 1 to 3600 seconds (default: 300
seconds)
- Can be disabled (set value to 0)
- Set to a low value if your requests are short
