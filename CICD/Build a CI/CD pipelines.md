# DORA Key Metrics

DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment) key metrics are used to measure the performance of software delivery and operational excellence. These metrics are essential for understanding the effectiveness of DevOps practices and how they impact both the development and operational aspects of software. The DORA metrics consist of the following four key performance indicators:

## Deployment Frequency:

What it measures: How often new code is deployed into production.

Why it's important: Frequent deployments indicate a well-established pipeline with a high level of automation and collaboration between development and operations teams. It shows the ability to deliver software changes to customers quickly and efficiently.

## Lead Time for Changes:

What it measures: The amount of time it takes from committing code to deploying it into production.

Why it's important: A shorter lead time for changes means faster feedback loops, enabling teams to quickly address issues, introduce new features, and adapt to user needs.

## Change Failure Rate:

What it measures: The percentage of changes that fail in production (e.g., requiring a rollback, hotfix, or patch).

Why it's important: A lower change failure rate indicates a more stable system and higher-quality code being deployed. It reflects the ability to deploy without causing disruptions to the end users.

## Time to Restore Service (Mean Time to Recovery, MTTR):

What it measures: The time it takes to recover from a failure in production.

Why it's important: A low MTTR shows the team's ability to quickly identify and resolve issues in production, minimizing downtime and service interruptions. It's crucial for maintaining user satisfaction and trust.

These metrics are typically divided into performance levels such as Elite, High, Medium, and Low based on the values measured. Organizations aim to improve these metrics continuously to ensure a high-performing, resilient, and efficient DevOps culture.
