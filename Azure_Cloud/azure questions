# Azure Blob Storage?
Azure Blob storage is the object storage solution provided by Microsoft for the cloud. Blob stands for “Binary Large Object”. Blob-based storage is used to store massive unstructured data in terms of text or binary format. It is ideal for serving documents/images/audio/video/text directly to browser.
The data stored in the blob storage is accessible from anywhere in the world. The blobs are tied to user accounts by grouping them into containers. The Azure Blob Service has 3 components:
Storage Account: This can be a General Storage Account or Blob Storage Account registered in Microsoft Azure.
Container: Container is used for grouping blobs. We can store an unlimited number of blobs in a container. The name of the container should start in lowercase.
Blob: A blob is a Binary Large Object like a file or document of any type and size. There are 3 kinds of Blobs supported by Azure:
Block blobs: These are intended for text and binary files and can support up to 195GB, i.e up to 50k blocks of up to 4MB each.
Append blobs: These are used for appending operations like logging data in log files.
Page blobs: These are meant for frequent read/write operations.

# What are the differences between Azure Scale Sets and Availability Sets?
The main difference  between Azure Scale Sets and Availability Sets are given below:

Criteria	Azure Scale Sets	Azure Availability Sets
Definition	They are a group of identically configured VMs that are spread across multiple fault domains.	They are the group of discretely configured VMs that are spread across various fault domains.
Default Domain	These have 5 fault domains and update domains by default.	By default, these have 3 fault domains and 5 update domains.
Workload Type	These are used when there are unpredictable workloads that require the feature of auto scalability.	These are used when there are predictable workload requirements.
Configuration Style	Here, the VMs are configured and created in the same manner from the same image.	Here, the VMs are created by making use of different images and configurations.
VM Count	The number of VMs can be increased/decreased based on the demand or the pre-defined schedule.	A VM can be added to an availability set only at the time of the set’s creation.
Distribution style	Here, the VM scale sets can be distributed across multiple data centers or within a single data center.	Here, the VMs are automatically distributed in a data center.

# What is Azure Redis Cache?
It is an open-source, in-memory Redis cache system provided and maintained by Azure.
It helps the web applications to improve the performance by fetching data from the backend database and storing it into the Redis cache for the first request and then fetching data from the Redis cache for all subsequent requests.
Azure Redis Cache provides powerful and secure caching mechanisms by making use of the Azure cloud.

# Define Azure virtual machine scale sets
These are the Azure computation resources that can be used to deploy and manage sets of identical Virtual Machines (VMs).
These scale sets are configured in the same manner and are designed to support the autoscaling of the applications without the need for pre-provisioning of the VMs.
They help to build large-scale applications targeting big data and containerized workloads in an easier manner.

# What do you understand about the “Availability Set”?
Availability Set is nothing but a logical grouping of VMs (Virtual Machines) that allows Azure cloud to understand how the application was developed for providing availability and redundancy.
Each VM in the availability set is assigned 2 kinds of domains by Azure:
Fault Domain: These define the grouping of VMs that would share a common power source and common network switch. The VMs within availability sets are separated across up to 3 fault domains by default. This separation of VMs in fault domains helps our applications to be available by reducing impacts of network outages, power interruptions, and certain hardware failures.
Update Domain: These indicate the grouping of VMs and underlying hardware which are eligible to be rebooted at the same time. Only one update domain can be rebooted at a time, however, the order of reboot does not proceed in a sequential manner. Before the maintenance of another update domain, the previously rebooted domain is given a recovery time of 30 minutes to ensure that the domain is up.
Azure provides flexibility to configure up to 3 fault domains and 20 update domains for an availability set.

# Define azure storage key.
Azure storage key is used for authentication for validating access for the azure storage service to control access of data based on the project requirements.
2 types of storage keys are given for the authentication purpose -
Primary Access Key
Secondary Access Key
The main purpose of the secondary access key is for avoiding downtime of the website or application.

# Azure load-balancing services
Here are the main load-balancing services currently available in Azure:

Azure Front Door is an application delivery network that provides global load balancing and site acceleration service for web applications. It offers Layer 7 capabilities for your application like SSL offload, path-based routing, fast failover, and caching to improve performance and high availability of your applications.

 Note

At this time, Azure Front Door doesn't support Web Sockets.

Traffic Manager is a DNS-based traffic load balancer that enables you to distribute traffic optimally to services across global Azure regions, while providing high availability and responsiveness. Because Traffic Manager is a DNS-based load-balancing service, it load balances only at the domain level. For that reason, it can't fail over as quickly as Azure Front Door, because of common challenges around DNS caching and systems not honoring DNS TTLs.

Application Gateway provides application delivery controller as a service, offering various Layer 7 load-balancing capabilities. Use it to optimize web farm productivity by offloading CPU-intensive SSL termination to the gateway.

Load Balancer is a high-performance, ultra-low-latency Layer 4 load-balancing service (inbound and outbound) for all UDP and TCP protocols. It's built to handle millions of requests per second while ensuring your solution is highly available. Load Balancer is zone redundant, ensuring high availability across availability zones. It supports both a regional deployment topology and a cross-region topology.

# data store models

## Relational database management systems

Relational databases organize data as a series of two-dimensional tables with rows and columns. Most vendors provide a dialect of the Structured Query Language (SQL) for retrieving and managing data. An RDBMS typically implements a transactionally consistent mechanism that conforms to the ACID (Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, Durable) model for updating information.

### Azure services
- Azure SQL Database | (Security Baseline)
- Azure Database for MySQL | (Security Baseline)
- Azure Database for PostgreSQL | (Security Baseline)
- Azure Database for MariaDB | (Security Baseline)

### Workload
- Records are frequently created and updated.
- Multiple operations have to be completed in a single transaction.
- Relationships are enforced using database constraints.
- Indexes are used to optimize query performance.

### Data type
- Data is highly normalized.
- Database schemas are required and enforced.
- Many-to-many relationships between data entities in the database.
- Constraints are defined in the schema and imposed on any data in the database.
- Data requires high integrity. Indexes and relationships need to be maintained accurately.
- Data requires strong consistency. Transactions operate in a way that ensures all data are 100% consistent for all users and processes.
- Size of individual data entries is small to medium-sized.

### Examples
Inventory management
Order management
Reporting database
Accounting

## Key/value stores

A key/value store associates each data value with a unique key. Most key/value stores only support simple query, insert, and delete operations. To modify a value (either partially or completely), an application must overwrite the existing data for the entire value. In most implementations, reading or writing a single value is an atomic operation.

### Azure services
- Azure Cosmos DB for Table and Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL | (Azure Cosmos DB Security Baseline)
- Azure Cache for Redis | (Security Baseline)
- Azure Table Storage | (Security Baseline)

### Workload
- Data is accessed using a single key, like a dictionary.
- No joins, lock, or unions are required.
- No aggregation mechanisms are used.
Secondary indexes are generally not used.
### Data type
- Each key is associated with a single value.
- There is no schema enforcement.
- No relationships between entities.

### Examples
Data caching
Session management
User preference and profile management
Product recommendation and ad serving

## Document databases
A document database stores a collection of documents, where each document consists of named fields and data. The data can be simple values or complex elements such as lists and child collections. Documents are retrieved by unique keys.

### Azure service
- Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL | (Azure Cosmos DB Security Baseline)
### Workload
- Insert and update operations are common.
- No object-relational impedance mismatch. Documents can better match the object structures used in application code.
- Individual documents are retrieved and written as a single block.
- Data requires index on multiple fields.
### Data type
- Data can be managed in de-normalized way.
- Size of individual document data is relatively small.
- Each document type can use its own schema.
- Documents can include optional fields.
- Document data is semi-structured, meaning that data types of each field are not strictly defined.
### Examples
Product catalog
Content management
Inventory management

## Graph databases
A graph database stores two types of information, nodes and edges. Edges specify relationships between nodes. Nodes and edges can have properties that provide information about that node or edge, similar to columns in a table. Edges can also have a direction indicating the nature of the relationship.

### Azure services
- Azure Cosmos DB for Apache Gremlin | (Security Baseline)
- SQL Server | (Security Baseline)

### Workload
- Complex relationships between data items involving many hops between related data items.
- The relationship between data items are dynamic and change over time.
- Relationships between objects are first-class citizens, without requiring foreign-keys and joins to traverse.
### Data type
- Nodes and relationships.
- Nodes are similar to table rows or JSON documents.
- Relationships are just as important as nodes, and are exposed directly in the query language.
- Composite objects, such as a person with multiple phone numbers, tend to be broken into separate, smaller nodes, combined with traversable relationships
### Examples
Organization charts
Social graphs
Fraud detection
Recommendation engines
